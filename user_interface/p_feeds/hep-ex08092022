The Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) Spallation Neutron Source (SNS) First Target Station (FTS), used by the COHERENT experiment, provides an intense and extremely high-quality source of pulsed stopped-pion neutrinos, with energies up to about 50 MeV. Upgrades to the SNS are planned, including a Second Target Station (STS), which will approximately double the expected neutrino flux while maintaining quality similar to the FTS source. Furthermore, additional space for ten-tonne scale detectors may be available. We describe here exciting opportunities for neutrino physics, other particle and nuclear physics, and detector development using the FTS and STS neutrino sources.

Testing the Gallium Anomaly - (cross-listed hep-ph)
Patrick Huber
We study the online detection by gallium capture of mono-energetic neutrinos produced by a $^{51}$Cr radioactive source in a scintillation experiment. We find that cerium-doped gadolinium aluminum gallium garnet (GAGG) is a suitable scintillator which contains about 21% of gallium per weight and has a high mass density and light yield. Combined with a highly efficient light detection system this allows tagging of the subsequent germanium decay and thus a clean distinction of gallium capture and elastic neutrino electron scattering events. With 1.5 tons of scintillator and 10 source runs of 3.4MCi, each, we obtain about 760 gallium capture events with a purity of 85% and 880,000 neutrino electron scattering events, where the latter provide a precise normalization independent of any nuclear physics. This configuration would allow to test the gallium anomaly at more than $5\sigma$ in an independent way.

Cluster time measurement with CEPC calorimeter - (cross-listed physics.ins-det)
Yuzhi Che,Vincent Boudry,Henri Videau,Muchen He,Manqi Ruan
We have developed an algorithm dedicated to timing reconstruction in highly granular calorimeters (HGC). The performance of this algorithm is evaluated on an electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL) with geometries comparable to the electromagnetic compartment (CE-E) of the CMS endcap calorimeter upgrade at HL-LHC and conceptual Particle Flow oriented ECAL's for future Higgs factories. The time response of individual channel is parameterized according to the CMS experimental result. The particle Time-of-Flight (ToF) can be measured with a resolution of $5\sim20 \;\rm{ps}$ for electromagnetic (EM) showers and $80\sim 160 \;\rm{ps}$ for hadronic showers above 1 GeV. The presented algorithm can significantly improve the time resolution, compared to a simple averaging of the fast component of the time spectrum. The effects of three detector configurations are also quantified in this study. ToF resolution depends linearly on the timing resolution of a single silicon sensor and improves statistically with increasing incident particle energy. A clustering algorithm that vetos isolated hits improves ToF resolution.

Tetraquark mixing supported by the partial decay widths of two light-meson nonets - (cross-listed hep-ph)
Hungchong Kim,K. S. Kim
Recently, the tetraquark mixing framework has been proposed as a possible structure for the two light-meson nonets in the $J^P=0^+$ channel, the light nonet composed of $a_0(980)$, $K_0^*(700)$, $f_0(500)$, $f_0(980)$, and the heavy nonet of $a_0(1450)$, $K_0^*(1430)$, $f_0(1370)$, $f_0(1500)$. Among various signatures, we report in this work that their partial decay widths collected from various experimental data in Particle Data Group (PDG) can support this mixing scheme also. In particular, we demonstrate that the couplings of the light nonet to two pseudoscalar mesons estimated from the partial widths are consistently stronger than those of the heavy nonet. This consistent feature agrees qualitatively well with the predictions from the tetraquark mixing framework and, therefore, provides supporting evidence for the tetraquark mixing.

Comparing Instrument Spectral Sensitivity of Dissimilar Electromagnetic Haloscopes to Axion Dark Matter and High Frequency Gravitational Waves - (cross-listed physics.ins-det)
Michael E. Tobar,Catriona A. Thomson,William M. Campbell,Aaron Quiskamp,Jeremy F. Bourhill,Benjamin T. McAllister,Eugene N. Ivanov,Maxim Goryachev
It is known that axion haloscopes that operate to search for dark matter axions via the 2-photon anomaly are also sensitive to gravitational waves (GWs) through the inverse Gertsenshtein effect. Recently this way of searching for high frequency GWs has gained momentum as it has been shown that the strain sensitivity of such detectors, h_g, are of the same order of sensitivity as the axion-photon theta angle, \theta_a, which is related to the axion 2-photon coupling, g_{a\gamma\gamma}, by, \theta_a = g_{a\gamma\gamma}a, where, a, is the axion scalar field. This means after calculating the sensitivity of a haloscope to an axion signal, we also have calculated the order of magnitude sensitivity to a GW signal of the same spectral and temporal form. However, it is unlikely that a GW and an axion signal will be of the same form since physically the way the signals are generated are completely different. For GW detection, the spectral strain sensitivity in units strain per square root Hz, and is the natural way to compare the sensitivity of GW detectors due to its independence on the GW signal. Likewise, one can define a spectral axion-photon theta angle sensitivity in units of theta angle per square root Hz for axion detectors, which is independent of the axion signal. In this work we introduce a systematic way to calculate the spectral sensitivity of an axion haloscope so instrument comparison may be achieved independent of signal assumptions and only depends on the axion to signal transduction sensitivity and noise in the instrument. Thus, the calculation of the spectral sensitivity not only allows the comparison of dissimilar axion detectors independent of signal, but also allows comparison of the GW sensitivity in terms of spectral strain sensitivity, allowing comparisons to standard GW detectors based on optical interferometers and resonant-mass technology.

IceCube, a cubic-kilometer array of optical sensors built to detect atmospheric and astrophysical neutrinos between 1 GeV and 1 PeV, is deployed 1.45 km to 2.45 km below the surface of the ice sheet at the South Pole. The classification and reconstruction of events from the in-ice detectors play a central role in the analysis of data from IceCube. Reconstructing and classifying events is a challenge due to the irregular detector geometry, inhomogeneous scattering and absorption of light in the ice and, below 100 GeV, the relatively low number of signal photons produced per event. To address this challenge, it is possible to represent IceCube events as point cloud graphs and use a Graph Neural Network (GNN) as the classification and reconstruction method. The GNN is capable of distinguishing neutrino events from cosmic-ray backgrounds, classifying different neutrino event types, and reconstructing the deposited energy, direction and interaction vertex. Based on simulation, we provide a comparison in the 1-100 GeV energy range to the current state-of-the-art maximum likelihood techniques used in current IceCube analyses, including the effects of known systematic uncertainties. For neutrino event classification, the GNN increases the signal efficiency by 18% at a fixed false positive rate (FPR), compared to current IceCube methods. Alternatively, the GNN offers a reduction of the FPR by over a factor 8 (to below half a percent) at a fixed signal efficiency. For the reconstruction of energy, direction, and interaction vertex, the resolution improves by an average of 13%-20% compared to current maximum likelihood techniques in the energy range of 1-30 GeV. The GNN, when run on a GPU, is capable of processing IceCube events at a rate nearly double of the median IceCube trigger rate of 2.7 kHz, which opens the possibility of using low energy neutrinos in online searches for transient events.

Strange mesons in nuclei and neutron stars - (cross-listed nucl-th)
Laura Tolos
The present status in the field of strange mesons in nuclei and neutron stars is reviewed. In particular, the $\bar K N$ interaction, that is governed by the presence of the $\Lambda(1405)$, is analyzed and the formation of the $\bar K NN$ bound state is discussed. Moreover, the properties of $\bar K$ in dense nuclear matter are studied, in connection with strangeness production in nuclear collisions and kaon condensation in neutron stars.

Free spectator nucleons in ultracentral relativistic heavy-ion collisions as a probe of neutron skin - (cross-listed nucl-th)
Lu-Meng Liu,Chun-Jian Zhang,Jun Xu,Jiangyong Jia,Guang-Xiong Peng
Besides the yield ratio of free spectator neutrons produced in ultracentral $^{96}$Zr+$^{96}$Zr to $^{96}$Ru+$^{96}$Ru collisions, we propose that the yield ratio $N_n/N_p$ of free spectator neutrons to protons in a single collision system at RHIC and LHC can be a more sensitive probe of the neutron-skin thickness $\Delta r_{\mathrm{np}}$ and the slope parameter $L$ of the symmetry energy. The idea is demonstrated based on the proton and neutron density distributions of colliding nuclei obtained from Skyrme-Hartree-Fock-Bogolyubov calculations, and a Glauber model that provides information of spectator matter. The final spectator particles are produced from direct emission, clusterization by a minimum spanning tree algorithm or a Wigner function approach, and deexcitation of heavy clusters by GEMINI. A larger $\Delta r_{\mathrm{np}}$ associated with a larger $L$ value increases the isospin asymmetry of spectator matter and thus leads to a larger $N_n/N_p$, especially in ultracentral collisions where the multiplicity of free nucleons are free from the uncertainties of cluster formation and deexcitation. We have further shown that the double ratio of $N_n/N_p$ in isobaric collision systems or in collisions by isotopes helps to cancel the detecting efficiency for protons. Effects from nuclear deformation and electromagnetic excitation are studied, and they are found to be subdominant compared to the expected sensitivity to $\Delta r_{\mathrm{np}}$.

Measurement of the time-integrated $C\!P$ asymmetry in $D^0\to K^- K^+$ decays
LHCb collaboration
The time-integrated $C\!P$ asymmetry in the Cabibbo-suppressed decay $D^0\to K^-K^+$ is measured using proton-proton collision data, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 5.7 fb$^{-1}$ collected at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV with the LHCb detector. The $D^0$ mesons are required to originate from promptly produced $D^{*+}\to D^0\pi^+$ decays and the charge of the companion pion is used to determine the flavor of the charm meson at production. The time-integrated $C\!P$ asymmetry is measured to be \begin{align*} \mathcal{A}_{C\!P}(K^-K^+) = \left[6.8 \pm 5.4 \text{ (stat)} \pm 1.6 \text{ (syst)} \right]\times 10^{-4}. \end{align*} The direct $C\!P$ asymmetries in $D^0\to K^- K^+$ and $D^0\to\pi^-\pi^+$ decays, $a_{K^-K^+}^{d}$ and $a_{\pi^-\pi^+}^{d}$, are derived by combining $\mathcal{A}_{C\!P} (K^-K^+)$ with the time-integrated $C\!P$ asymmetry difference, $\Delta \mathcal{A}_{C\!P} =\mathcal{A}_{C\!P} (K^-K^+)-\mathcal{A}_{C\!P} (\pi^-\pi^+)$, giving \begin{alignat*}{2} a_{K^-K^+}^{d} &= (\phantom{2}7.7 \pm 5.7) \times 10^{-4}, \end{alignat*} \begin{alignat*}{2} a_{\pi^-\pi^+}^{d} &= (23.2 \pm 6.1) \times 10^{-4}, \end{alignat*} with a correlation coefficient corresponding to $\rho=0.88$. The compatibility of these results with $C\!P$ symmetry is 1.4 and 3.8 standard deviations for $D^0\to K^- K^+$ and $D^0\to\pi^-\pi^+$ decays, respectively. This is the first evidence for direct $C\!P$ violation in a specific $D^0$ decay.

Center-of-mass energy determination using $\mathrm{e}^{+} \mathrm{e}^{-} \to μ^{+} μ^{-} (γ)$ events at future $\mathrm{e}^{+} \mathrm{e}^{-}$ colliders
Brendon Madison,Graham W. Wilson
Methods for measuring the absolute center-of-mass energy, $\sqrt{s}$, and its distribution, are investigated for future $\mathrm{e}^{+} \mathrm{e}^{-}$ Higgs-factory colliders using in situ $\mathrm{e}^{+} \mathrm{e}^{-}$ collisions. We emphasize the potential of an estimator based on the measurement of muon momenta that we denote $\sqrt{s}_{p}$. It can be determined with high precision in $\mathrm{e}^{+} \mathrm{e}^{-} \to \mu^{+} \mu^{-} (\gamma)$ events while being sensitive to effects from beam energy spread, beamstrahlung, initial-state radiation (ISR), final-state radiation (FSR), crossing angle, and detector resolution. The measurement precision is enabled by a high-precision low-mass tracker; the reported performance estimates are based on full simulation of the tracker response of the ILD detector concept for the ILC operating at $\sqrt{s}=250$ GeV. The underlying statistical precision is 2 ppm for a 2 ${\mathrm{ab}^{-1}}$ dataset at ILC. The ultimate utility will depend largely on how well one can calibrate and maintain the tracker momentum scale.

Model-Agnostic Exploration of the Mass Reach of Precision Higgs Boson Coupling Measurements - (cross-listed hep-ph)
Michael E. Peskin
To understand the possibility for precision Higgs boson coupling measurements to access effects of very heavy new particles, I present five scenarios in which significant deviations in Higgs boson couplings are produced by new particles with multi-TeV masses. These scenarios indicate that such precision measurements provide opportunities to reach well beyond the capabilities of direct particle searches at the HL-LHC.

Single Vector-Like top quark production via chromomagnetic interactions at present and future hadron colliders $-$A Snowmass 2021 White Paper - (cross-listed hep-ph)
Alexander Belyaev,R. Sekhar Chivukula,Benjamin Fuks,Elizabeth H. Simmons,Xing Wang
In our recent paper, we have investigated the potential for the LHC to discover vector-like quark partner states singly produced via their chromomagnetic moment interactions. These production mechanisms extend traditional searches which rely on pair-production of top-quark partner states or on the single production of these states through electroweak interactions, in the sense of providing greatly increased reach in parameter space regions where traditional searches are insensitive. In this study we determine the potential of both the 14 TeV high-luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) and a 100 TeV proton-proton collider to probe new vector-like quarks produced in this mode. We focus on the single production of a top-quark partner in association with an ordinary top-quark, as well as on the resonant production of the bottom-quark partner with its subsequent decay to a top-quark partner and a $W$ boson. For both cases we consider a top-partner decay to the Higgs boson and an ordinary top-quark. We find that HL-LHC and a future 100 TeV proton collider can probe vector-like partner masses up to about 3 TeV and 15-20 TeV respectively, visibly extending the range of the traditional vector like quark partner searches.

Report of the Topical Group on Neutrino Properties for Snowmass 2021 - (cross-listed hep-ph)
Carlo Giunti,Julieta Gruszko,Benjamin Jones,Lisa Kaufman,Diana Parno,Andrea Pocar
Neutrinos are the most elusive among the known elementary particles, because of their feeble interactions with ordinary matter. They are also the most mysterious, because of their tiny masses that suggest a novel mass generating mechanism, their unknown Dirac or Majorana nature, and their big quantum mixing leading to large-amplitude flavor oscillations. This Topical Group focuses on neutrino properties that are not directly investigated in other Topical Groups of the Neutrino Frontier: in particular, the absolute value of the neutrino masses, the Dirac or Majorana nature of neutrinos, their electromagnetic properties, their lifetime, and hypothetical exotic properties.
