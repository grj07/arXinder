Standard Model Predictions for Rare K and B Decays without New Physics Infection - (cross-listed hep-ph)
Andrzej J. Buras
The Standard Model (SM) does not contain by definition any new physics (NP) contributions to any observable but contains four CKM parameters which are not predicted by this model. We point out that if these four parameters are determined in a global fit that includes processes which are infected by NP, the resulting SM contributions to rare decay branching ratios cannot be considered as true SM contributions to the latter. On the other hand true SM predictions, that are free from the CKM dependence, can be obtained for suitable ratios of the $K$ and $B$ rare decay branching ratios to $\Delta M_s$, $\Delta M_d$ and $|\varepsilon_K|$, all calculated within the SM. These three observables contain by now only small hadronic uncertainties and are already well measured so that rather precise true SM predictions for the ratios in question can be obtained. In this context the rapid test of NP infection in the $\Delta F=2$ sector is provided by a $|V_{cb}|-\gamma$ plot that involves $\Delta M_s$, $\Delta M_d$, $|\varepsilon_K|$, and the mixing induced CP-asymmetry $S_{\psi K_S}$. As with the present hadronic matrix elements this test turns out to be negative, assuming negligible NP infection in the $\Delta F=2$ sector and setting the values of these four observables to the experimental ones, allows to obtain SM predictions for all $K$ and $B$ rare decay branching ratios that are most accurate to date and as a byproduct to obtain the full CKM matrix on the basis of $\Delta F=2$ transitions alone. Using this strategy we obtain SM predictions for 26 branching ratios for rare semileptonic and leptonic $K$ and $B$ decays with the $\mu^+\mu^-$ pair or the $\nu\bar\nu$ pair in the final state. Most interesting turn out to be the anomalies in the low $q^2$ bin in $B^+\to K^+\mu^+\mu^-$ ($5.1\sigma$) and $B_s\to \phi\mu^+\mu^-$ ($4.8\sigma$).

Quantum discord and steering in top quarks at the LHC - (cross-listed quant-ph)
Yoav Afik,Juan Ramón Muñoz de Nova
Top quarks have been recently shown to be a promising system to study quantum information problems at the highest-energy scale available. The current lines of research mostly discuss topics such as entanglement, Bell nonlocality or quantum tomography. Here, we provide the full picture of quantum correlations with top quarks by studying also quantum discord and steering. We find that both phenomena are present at the LHC. In particular, quantum discord in a separable quantum state is expected to be detected with high-statistical significance. Interestingly, due to the singular nature of the measurement process, quantum discord can be measured following its original definition, and the steering ellipsoid can be experimentally reconstructed, both highly-demanding measurements in conventional setups. In contrast to entanglement, the asymmetric nature of quantum discord and steering can provide witnesses of new physics beyond the Standard Model.

MoEDAL-MAPP, an LHC Dedicated Detector Search Facility - (cross-listed hep-ph)
James Pinfold
During LHC's Run-2 the MoEDAL experiment, the LHC's first dedicated search experiment, took over 6 fb^-1 of data at IP8, with p-p and Pb-Pb collisions, operating with 100% efficiency. The LHCC has endorsed the LoI of the MoEDAL Collaboration describing an exciting program to expand the search for Highly Ionizing Particles (HIPs) in p-p and heavy-ion collisions to include feebly ionizing and Long Lived Particle (LLP) messengers of new physics (NP) at LHC's RUN-3 and eventually HL-LHC. In 2021, as part of Phase-1 of the program, the baseline MoEDAL detector was approved by CERN for reinstallation for Run-3 with increased efficiency, lower threshold, a factor of 5 increase in instantaneous luminosity, and, a higher Ecm. MoEDAL will continue the search for HIP avatars of NP with an emphasis on the search for massive, single and multiply electrically charged avatars of BSM physics arising from, eg, supersymmetry, neutrino mass models, L-R symmetry, etc. As part of Phase-1 of the MoEDAL-MAPP project CERN also approved in 2021 the installation of the MoEDAL Apparatus for Penetrating Particles (MAPP) in the UA83 tunnel 100m away from IP8. The MAPP detector has sensitivity to feebly-interacting particles with charge, or effective charge, as low as 10^-3e. Additionally, the MAPP detector, in conjunction with MoEDAL's trapping detector, gives us a unique sensitivity to charged LLPs. MAPP also has some sensitivity to neutral LLPs. In Phase-2 of the project we will instal the MAPP-2 upgrade for the HL-LHC. We envisage that this detector will be deployed in the UGC1 gallery near to IP8. This phase of the experiment is designed to ensure that MoEDAL-MAPP's sensitivity to neutral LLP messengers of BSM physics is competitive and complementary to other planned projects in this arena. Initial MoEDAL plans for the MEDICI facility at the 100 TeV FCC-hh machine will also be briefly presented.

An Efficient, Scalable IO Framework for Sparse Data: larcv3
Corey Adams,Kazuhiro Terao,Marco Del Tutto,Taritree Wongjirad
Neutrino physics is one of the fundamental areas of research into the origins and properties of the Universe. Many experimental neutrino projects use sophisticated detectors to observe properties of these particles, and have turned to deep learning and artificial intelligence techniques to analyze their data. From this, we have developed \texttt{larcv}, a \texttt{C++} and \texttt{Python} based framework for efficient IO of sparse data with particle physics applications in mind. We describe in this paper the \texttt{larcv} framework and some benchmark IO performance tests. \texttt{larcv} is designed to enable fast and efficient IO of ragged and irregular data, at scale on modern HPC systems, and is compatible with the most popular open source data analysis tools in the Python ecosystem.

Fixed-target charmonium production and pion parton distributions - (cross-listed hep-ph)
Wen-Chen Chang,Jen-Chieh Peng,Stephane Platchkov,Takahiro Sawada
We investigate how charmonium hadroproduction at fixed-target energies can be used to constrain the gluon distribution in pion. Using non-relativistic QCD (NRQCD) formulation, the $J/\psi$ and $\psi(2S)$ cross sections as a function of longitudinal momentum fraction $x_F$ from pions and protons colliding with light targets, as well as the $\psi(2S)$ to $J/\psi$ cross section ratios, are included in the analysis. The color-octet long-distance matrix elements are found to have a pronounced dependence on the pion parton distribution functions (PDFs). This study shows that the $x_F$ differential cross sections of pion-induced charmonium production impose strong constraints on the pion's quark and gluon PDFs. In particular, the pion PDFs with larger gluon densities provide a significantly better description of the data. It is also found that the production of the $\psi(2S)$ state is associated with a larger quark-antiquark contribution, compared with $J/\psi$.

Higgs boson in a flavor-extension of the CMSSM - (cross-listed hep-ph)
Surabhi Gupta,Sudhir Kumar Gupta,Keven Ren
Flavour-violating couplings of Higgs boson with stop and scharm quarks could be very important as in addition to lifting the mass of the Higgs boson by a few GeV, it could also play a vital phenomenological role in reducing the Supersymmetry breaking scale significantly. In this work, we investigate effects of such flavour-violating couplings within the Constrained Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (CMSSM) framework in the context of LEP data, Higgs data at the LHC, precision observables and the relic density of the dark matter using Bayesian statistics. Our detailed analysis reveals that the most probable values of $m_{0}$, $m_{1/2}$, $A_{0}$, $\tan{\beta}$, $\delta^{LR}_{ct}$ are expected to be around 4.83 TeV, 2.54 TeV, 1.90 TeV, 41.5, and 6.1$\times10^{-2}$, respectively, with flat priors. The corresponding values translate into 3.25 TeV, 2.13 TeV, 1.90 TeV, 44.7, and 5.9$\times10^{-2}$, respectively, if the natural priors are used. Furthermore, a comparison of our model with the CMSSM of flavour-conservation as the base model yields a Bayes factor of about 6 while taking into account all the experimental constraints used in our study. Our analysis also reflects that the lightest neutralino would have a mass of about 1 TeV.

Performance of the ALICE Electromagnetic Calorimeter - (cross-listed physics.ins-det)
ALICE Collaboration
The performance of the electromagnetic calorimeter of the ALICE experiment during operation in 2010-2018 at the Large Hadron Collider is presented. After a short introduction into the design, readout, and trigger capabilities of the detector, the procedures for data taking, reconstruction, and validation are explained. The methods used for the calibration and various derived corrections are presented in detail. Subsequently, the capabilities of the calorimeter to reconstruct and measure photons, light mesons, electrons and jets are discussed. The performance of the calorimeter is illustrated mainly with data obtained with test beams at the Proton Synchrotron and Super Proton Synchrotron or in proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV, and compared to simulations.

The $\mathbf{X(3872)}$'s excitation and its connection with production at hadron colliders - (cross-listed hep-ph)
M.C. Gordillo,F. De Soto,J. Segovia
The LHCb collaboration has found that the production rate of $X(3872)$ in proton-proton collisions decreases as final state particle multiplicity increases. Moreover, the ALICE experiment at CERN has observed that the number of deuterons produced increases with multiplicity, a behavior that is qualitatively different from that of the $X(3872)$. These experimental findings may point to a compact structure for the $X(3872)$ or, at least, that its hadronization could proceed through a charm-anticharm core. We have recently used a diffusion Monte Carlo method to solve the many-body Schr\"odinger equation that describes the $X(3872)$ as a $c \bar c q \bar q$ tetraquark system with quantum numbers $I^G(J^{PC})=0^+(1^{++})$ and $1^-(1^{++})$. According to our structural analysis, the quark--(anti-)quark correlations resemble light-meson--heavy-meson molecules of type $\omega J/\psi$ and $\rho J/\psi$, rather than the most extended $D\bar D^{\ast}$ interpretation. It was argued that this fact may be the key to make compatible the molecular features of the $X(3872)$ with its production observables. The same formalism allows us to compute the first color excited $c \bar c q \bar q$ tetraquark state with either $I^G(J^{PC})=0^+(1^{++})$ or $1^-(1^{++})$. A bound-state is found in each channel, their masses are around 4.0 GeV which is an energy region where many new exotic candidates have been collected by the Particle Data Group. Concerning their structural properties, these states cluster in a compact diquark-antidiquark arrangement which matches perfectly with a so-called Born-Oppenheimer tetraquark configuration. The promptly production rates of these states in proton-proton, proton-nucleus and nucleus-nucleus collisions should fall off equal to or even faster than those of the $X(3872)$.

Neutron emission in ultraperipheral Pb-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}} = 502$ TeV - (cross-listed nucl-ex)
ALICE Collaboration
In ultraperipheral collisions (UPCs) of relativistic nuclei without overlap of nuclear densities, the two nuclei are excited by the Lorentz-contracted Coulomb fields of their collision partners. In these UPCs, the typical nuclear excitation energy is below a few tens of MeV, and a small number of nucleons are emitted in electromagnetic dissociation (EMD) of primary nuclei, in contrast to complete nuclear fragmentation in hadronic interactions. The cross sections of emission of given numbers of neutrons in UPCs of $^{208}$Pb nuclei at $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}}=5.02$ TeV were measured with the neutron zero degree calorimeters (ZDCs) of the ALICE detector at the LHC, exploiting a similar technique to that used in previous studies performed at $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}}=2.76$ TeV. In addition, the cross sections for the exclusive emission of 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 forward neutrons in the EMD, not accompanied by the emission of forward protons, and thus mostly corresponding to the production of $^{207,206,205,204,203}$Pb, respectively, were measured for the first time. The predictions from the available models describe the measured cross sections well. These cross sections can be used for evaluating the impact of secondary nuclei on the LHC components, in particular, on superconducting magnets, and also provide useful input for the design of the Future Circular Collider (FCC-hh).

More than a century after the performance of the oil drop experiment, the possible existence of fractionally charged particles FCP still remains unsettled. The search for FCPs is crucial for some extensions of the Standard Model in particle physics. Most of the previously conducted searches for FCPs in cosmic rays were based on experiments underground or at high altitudes. However, there have been few searches for FCPs in cosmic rays carried out in orbit other than AMS-01 flown by a space shuttle and BESS by a balloon at the top of the atmosphere. In this study, we conduct an FCP search in space based on on-orbit data obtained using the DArk Matter Particle Explorer (DAMPE) satellite over a period of five years. Unlike underground experiments, which require an FCP energy of the order of hundreds of GeV, our FCP search starts at only a few GeV. An upper limit of $6.2\times 10^{-10}~~\mathrm{cm^{-2}sr^{-1} s^{-1}}$ is obtained for the flux. Our results demonstrate that DAMPE exhibits higher sensitivity than experiments of similar types by three orders of magnitude that more stringently restricts the conditions for the existence of FCP in primary cosmic rays.

Snowmass 2021 topical group report: Neutrinos from Natural Sources - (cross-listed hep-ph)
Yusuke Koshio,Gabriel D. Orebi Gann,Erin O'Sullivan,Irene Tamborra
This is the final report from the Snowmass 2021 Neutrino Frontier Topical Group on Neutrinos from Natural Sources. It covers a broad range of neutrino sources, from low-energy neutrinos from the early universe to ultra high-energy sources. We divide this report by source, and discuss the motivations for pursuing searches in each case, the current state of the field, and the prospects for future theoretical and experimental developments. We consider neutrinos produced in the early universe; solar neutrinos; geoneutrinos; supernova neutrinos, including the diffuse supernova neutrino background (DSNB); neutrinos produced in the atmosphere; and high-energy astrophysical neutrinos.

The Recoil Proton Polarization: a new discriminative DVCS observable - (cross-listed hep-ph)
Olga Bessidskaia Bylund,Maxime Defurne,Pierre A. M. Guichon, CEA, Université Paris-Saclay, 91191, Gif-sur-Yvette, France)
Generalized parton distributions describe the correlations between the longitudinal momentum and the transverse position of quarks and gluons in a nucleon. They can be constrained by measuring photon leptoproduction observables, arising from the interference between Bethe-Heitler and Deeply virtual Compton scattering processes. At leading-twist/leading-order, the amplitude of the latter is parameterized by complex integrals of the GPDs {H, E, \~H, \~E} . As data collected on an unpolarized or longitudinally polarized target constrains H and \~H, E is poorly known as it requires data collected with a transversely polarized target, which is very challenging to implement in fixed target experiments. The only alternative considered so far has been DVCS on a neutron with a deuterium target, while assuming isospin symmetry and absence of final-state interactions. Today, we introduce the polarization of the recoil proton as a new DVCS observable, highly sensitive to E, which appears feasible for an experimental study at a high-luminosity facility such as Jefferson Lab.

In this white paper, we present the MegaMapper concept. The MegaMapper is a proposed ground-based experiment to measure Inflation parameters and Dark Energy from galaxy redshifts at $2<z<5$. In order to achieve path-breaking results with a mid-scale investment, the MegaMapper combines existing technologies for critical path elements and pushes innovative development in other design areas. To this aim, we envision a 6.5-m Magellan-like telescope, with a newly designed wide field, coupled with DESI spectrographs, and small-pitch robots to achieve multiplexing of at least 26,000. This will match the expected achievable target density in the redshift range of interest and provide a 10x capability over the existing state-of the art, without a 10x increase in project budget.

Measurement of the production of (anti)(hyper)nuclei
Chiara Pinto
In recent years, ALICE has extensively studied the production of light (anti)(hyper)nuclei in different collision systems and center-of-mass energies. Nevertheless, the production mechanisms of light (hyper)nuclei is still unclear and under intense debate in the scientific community. Two classes of models are typically used to describe nuclear production: the statistical hadronisation model and the coalescence ones. In heavy-ion collisions, both models describe well the production yields of light nuclei and their ratios to the yields of hadrons, making it difficult to distinguish between the two. On the contrary, small collision systems, such as pp and p-Pb collisions, are ideal to study the (anti)(hyper)nuclei production mechanisms, thanks to the large separation between the different predictions. In this paper, recent results on light nuclei production measured with ALICE at the LHC in small collision systems are discussed in the context of the nucleosynthesis models, allowing us to exclude some configurations of the SHM and coalescence models in order to set tighter constraints to the available theoretical predictions.
