A new approach to semi-leptonic tags in $B$-meson semi-invisible decays - (cross-listed hep-ph)
Gaetano de Marino,Diego Guadagnoli,Chan Beom Park,Karim Trabelsi
Kinematic variables designed for pairwise decays to partly undetected final states -- a prominent example being $M_{T2}$ and its Lorentz-invariant version $M_2$ -- have been extensively deployed in high-$p_T$ collider searches. A new range of potential applications at flavour facilities -- where $B$ mesons or $\tau$ leptons are also pairwise produced -- was recently proposed.   One general challenge in these decays arises if both the signal parent and the 'other' parent, often used as a tag, decay semi-invisibly. In such cases, which notably include semi-leptonic tags, signal identification is generally hindered by the ensuing lack of knowledge of the signal-parent boost. $M_2$ helps precisely to overcome this challenge, and allows to leverage the otherwise superior efficiency of semi-leptonic decays.   Our strategy rests on two novel constraints that can be imposed on $M_2$. The first is that of the known mass of the decaying-parent mass squared which, in connection with other constraints, gives rise to $M_{2sB}$. The second is on the flight direction of the signal parent, often well reconstructed at facilities with high vertexing capabilities such as Belle II and LHCb. This constraint gives rise to the $M_{2V}$ variable, that can be used even at facilities where the collision energy is not known.   We test these ideas in a decay of great current interest in the context of the persistent discrepancies in $B$ decays, namely $B \to K \tau \mu$. We find that a bare-bones application of $M_{2sB}$ leads, alone, to an improvement that is already halfway between the current approach and the "truth-level" semi-leptonic case. Ceteris paribus -- in particular statistics -- our approach thus makes semi-leptonic tags competitive with fully reconstructed hadronic tags.

Wideband Direct Detection Constraints on Hidden Photon Dark Matter with the QUALIPHIDE Experiment - (cross-listed astro-ph.CO)
Karthik Ramanathan,Nikita Klimovich,Ritoban Basu Thakur,Byeong Ho Eom,Henry G. LeDuc,Shibo Shu,Andrew D. Beyer,Peter K. Day
We report direction detection constraints on the presence of hidden photon dark matter with masses between 20-30 ueV using a cryogenic emitter-receiver-amplifier spectroscopy setup designed as the first iteration of QUALIPHIDE (QUantum LImited PHotons In the Dark Experiment). A metallic dish sources conversion photons from hidden photon kinetic mixing onto a horn antenna which is coupled to a C-band kinetic inductance traveling wave parametric amplifier, providing for near quantum-limited noise performance. We demonstrate a first probing of the kinetic mixing parameter "chi" to just above 10^-12 for the majority of hidden photon masses in this region. These results not only represent stringent constraints on new dark matter parameter space but are also the first demonstrated use of wideband quantum-limited amplification for astroparticle applications

T-odd Leading-Twist Quark TMDs at Small $x$ - (cross-listed hep-ph)
Yuri V. Kovchegov,M. Gabriel Santiago
We study the small-$x$ asymptotics of the flavor non-singlet T-odd leading-twist quark transverse momentum dependent parton distributions (TMDs), the Sivers and Boer-Mulders functions. While the leading eikonal small-$x$ asymptotics of the quark Sivers function is given by the spin-dependent odderon, we are interested in revisiting the sub-eikonal correction considered by us earlier. We first simplify the expressions for both TMDs at small Bjorken $x$ and then construct small-$x$ evolution equations for the resulting operators in the large-$N_c$ limit, with $N_c$ the number of quark colors. For both TMDs, the evolution equations resum all powers of the double-logarithmic parameter $\alpha_s \, \ln^2 (1/x)$, where $\alpha_s$ is the strong coupling constant, which is assumed to be small. Solving these evolution equations numerically (for the Sivers function) and analytically (for the Boer-Mulders function) we arrive at the following leading small-$x$ asymptotics of these TMDs at large $N_c$: \begin{align} f_{1 \: T}^{\perp \: NS} (x \ll 1 ,k_T^2) & = C_O (x, k_T^2) \, \frac{1}{x} + C_1 (x, k_T^2) \, \left( \frac{1}{x} \right)^{3.4 \, \sqrt{\frac{\alpha_s \, N_c}{4 \pi}}} , \notag \\ h_1^{\perp \, \textrm{NS}} (x \ll 1, k_T^2) & = C (x, k_T^2) \left( \frac{1}{x} \right)^{-1}. \notag \end{align} The functions $C_O (x, k_T^2)$, $C_1 (x, k_T^2)$, and $C (x, k_T^2)$ can be readily obtained in our formalism: they are mildly $x$-dependent and do not strongly affect the power-of-$x$ asymptotics shown above. The function $C_O$, along with the $1/x$ factor, arises from the odderon exchange. For the sub-eikonal contribution to the quark Sivers function (the term with $C_1$), our result shown above supersedes the one obtained in our previous work due to the new contributions identified recently.

Practical use of reactor anti-neutrinos for nuclear safeguard in Vietnam
Son Cao,T. V. Ngoc,N. T. Hong Van,P. T. Quyen
One of the most abundant man-made sources of low energy (few~MeVs) neutrinos, reactor neutrino, is not only useful for studying neutrino properties, but it is also used in practical applications. In this study, we investigate the practical use of reactor neutrino detectors for nuclear safeguard in Vietnam, specifically at the Dalat Nuclear Reactor, a future research facility, and presumably commercial reactors with 500~kW, 10~MW, and 1000~MW thermal powers, respectively. We compute the rate of observed inverted beta decay events, as well as the statistical significance of extracting isotope composition under the practical assumptions of detector mass, detection efficiency, and background level. We find that a 1-ton detector mass can allow us to detect the reactor's on-off transition state from a few hours to a few days, depending on the standoff distance and reactor thermal power. We investigate how background and energy resolution affect the precision of the extracted weapon-usable ${}^{239}\text{Pu}$ isotope. We conclude that in order to distinguish the 10\% variation of the ${}^{239}\text{Pu}$ in the 10~MW thermal power reactor, a 1-ton detector placed 50~m away must achieve 1\% background level. Increasing the statistics by using a 10x larger detector or placing it $\sqrt{10}$ times closer to the reactor alleviates the requirement of the background level to 10\%.

In this white paper, we present an experimental road map for spectroscopic experiments beyond DESI. DESI will be a transformative cosmological survey in the 2020s, mapping 40 million galaxies and quasars and capturing a significant fraction of the available linear modes up to z=1.2. DESI-II will pilot observations of galaxies both at much higher densities and extending to higher redshifts. A Stage-5 experiment would build out those high-density and high-redshift observations, mapping hundreds of millions of stars and galaxies in three dimensions, to address the problems of inflation, dark energy, light relativistic species, and dark matter. These spectroscopic data will also complement the next generation of weak lensing, line intensity mapping and CMB experiments and allow them to reach their full potential.

Solid State Detectors and Tracking for Snowmass - (cross-listed physics.ins-det)
Anthony Affolder,Artur Apresyan,Steven Worm
Tracking detectors are of vital importance for collider-based high energy physics (HEP) experiments. The primary purpose of tracking detectors is the precise reconstruction of charged particle trajectories and the reconstruction of secondary vertices. The performance requirements from the community posed by the future collider experiments require an evolution of tracking systems, necessitating the development of new techniques, materials and technologies in order to fully exploit their physics potential. In this article we summarize the discussions and conclusions of the 2022 Snowmass Instrumentation Frontier subgroup on Solid State and Tracking Detectors (Snowmass IF03).

Bracketing the direct detection exclusion plot for a WIMP of spin one half in non-relativistic effective theory - (cross-listed hep-ph)
Sunghyun Kang,Injun Jeong,Stefano Scopel
Assuming a standard Maxwellian velocity distribution for the WIMPs in the halo of our Galaxy we use the null results of an exhaustive set of 6 direct detection experiments to calculate the maximal variation of the exclusion plot for each Wilson coefficient of the most general Galilean-invariant effective Hamiltonian for a WIMP of spin one half due to interferences. We consider 56 Wilson coefficients $c_i^{p,n}$ and $\alpha_i^{n,p}$ for WIMP-proton and WIMP-neutron contact interactions ${\cal O}_i^{p,n}$ and the corresponding long range interaction ${\cal O}_i^{p,n}/q^2$, parameterized by a massless propagator $1/q^2$. For each coupling we provide a different exclusion plot when the following set of operators is allowed to interfere: proton-neutron, i.e. $c_i^{p}$-$c_i^{n}$ or $\alpha_i^{p}$-$\alpha_i^{n}$; contact-contact or long range-long range, i.e. $c_i^{p,n}$-$c_j^{p,n}$ or $\alpha_i^{p,n}$-$\alpha_j^{p,n}$; contact-long range, i.e. $c_i^{p,n}$-$\alpha_j^{p,n}$. For each of the 56 Wilson coefficients $c_i^{p,n}$ and $\alpha_j^{p,n}$ and for the largest number of interfering operators the exclusion plot variation can reach 3 orders of magnitude and reduces to a factor as small as a few for the Wilson coefficients of the effective interactions where the WIMP couples to the nuclear spin, thanks to the combination of experiments using proton-odd and neutron-odd targets. Some of the conservative bounds require an extremely high level of cancellation, putting into question the reliability of the result. We analyze this issue in a systematic way, showing that it affects some of the couplings driven by the operators ${\cal O}_{1}$, ${\cal O}_{3}$, ${\cal O}_{11}$, ${\cal O}_{12}$ and ${\cal O}_{15}$, especially when interferences among contact and long range interactions are considered.

Spin polarization measurements in relativistic heavy-ion collisions
Debojit Sarkar
The hot and dense matter formed in relativistic heavy-ion collisions at Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is termed quark-gluon plasma (QGP). The evolution of the medium is characterized by non-trivial velocity and vorticity fields, resulting in the polarization of the produced particles. The spin polarization, being sensitive to the hydrothermal (flow velocity and temperature) gradients, is unique compared to conventional observables that are sensitive to the hydrothermal fields only. Hence, the recent measurements of global and local hyperon spin polarization and vector meson spin alignment by the LHC and STAR collaborations provide a unique opportunity to probe the QGP substructure with finer details.

Measurement of the CKM angle $γ$ with $ B^\pm \to D[K^\mp π^\pm π^\pm π^\mp] h^\pm$ decays using a binned phase-space approach
LHCb collaboration
The CKM angle $\gamma$ is determined from $C\!P$-violating observables measured in ${B^\pm \to D[ K^\mp \pi^\pm\pi^\pm\pi^\mp] h^\pm}$, $(h = K,\pi)$ decays, where the measurements are performed in bins of the decay phase-space of the $D$ meson. Using proton-proton collision data collected by the LHCb experiment at centre-of-mass energies of $7, 8$ and $13\,\text{TeV}$, corresponding to a total integrated luminosity of $9\,\text{fb}^{-1}$, $\gamma$ is determined to be \begin{equation*} \gamma = \left( 54.8 \: ^{+\:6.0 }_{-\:5.8} \: ^{+\:0.6}_{-\:0.6} \: ^{+\:6.7}_{-\:4.3} \right)^\circ, \end{equation*} where the first uncertainty is statistical, the second systematic and the third from the external inputs on the coherence factors and strong phases of the $D$-meson decays.

Snowmass Topical Group Summary Report: IF04 -- Trigger and Data Acquisition Systems - (cross-listed physics.ins-det)
Darin Acosta,Allison Deiana,Wesley Ketchum
A trend for future high energy physics experiments is an increase in the data bandwidth produced from the detectors. Datasets of the Petabyte scale have already become the norm, and the requirements of future experiments -- greater in size, exposure, and complexity -- will further push the limits of data acquisition technologies to data rates of exabytes per seconds. The challenge for these future data-intensive physics facilities lies in the reduction of the flow of data through a combination of sophisticated event selection in the form of high-performance triggers and improved data representation through compression and calculation of high-level quantities. These tasks must be performed with low-latency (i.e. in real-time) and often in extreme environments including high radiation, high magnetic fields, and cryogenic temperatures.

$M_W$, Dark Matter and $a_μ$ in the NMSSM - (cross-listed hep-ph)
Florian Domingo,Ulrich Ellwanger,Cyril Hugonie
We study regions in the parameter space of the NMSSM which are able to simultaneously explain the current measured values for the $W$ mass $M_W$ and the muon anomalous magnetic moment $a_\mu$, and provide a dark matter relic density consistent with the observations as well as constraints from detection experiments. The corresponding regions feature light charginos, sleptons and staus in the 100-800~GeV range, at least some of them with masses below 150~GeV such that the electroweakly-interacting SUSY particles generate sufficiently large contributions to $M_W$. The LSP is always singlino-like with a mass below 140~GeV, and could possibly remain invisible even at future detection experiments. Decays of electroweak sparticles proceed through cascades via staus and/or sleptons which makes their detection challenging. We propose benchmark points for future searches of such sparticles. The lightest CP-even scalar may have a mass in the 95-98~GeV range with, however, modest signal rates in view of the mild excesses reported in this range at LEP and by CMS at the LHC.

This paper reports on the design and construction of infrastructure and test stations for small-diameter monitored drift tube (sMDT) assembly and testing at the University of Michigan (UM) to prepare for the ATLAS Muon Spectrometer upgrade for the high-luminosity program of the Large Hadron Collider. Procedures of the tube assembly and quality assurance and control (QA/QC) tests are described in detail. More than 99% of the tubes meet the tube QA/QC specifications based on 2100 tubes built at UM. The UM test stations are also used for QA/QC testing on the tubes constructed at Michigan State University. These tubes are being used to construct the sMDT chambers which will replace the current MDT chambers of the barrel inner station of the Muon Spectrometer.

Random statistical analysis of transverse momentum spectra of strange particles and dependence of related parameters on centrality in high energy collisions at the LHC - (cross-listed hep-ph)
Xu-Hong Zhang,Fu-Hu Liu,Khusniddin K. Olimov,Airton Deppman
We have studied the transverse momentum ($p_T$) spectra of the final-state strange particles, including $K^{\pm}$, $\phi$, $\it\Xi$, and $\it\Omega$, produced in high energy lead-lead (Pb-Pb), proton-lead ($p$-Pb), xenon-xenon (Xe-Xe) collisions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Taking into account the contribution of multi-quark composition, whose probability density distribution is described by the modified Tsallis-Pareto-type function, we simulate the $p_T$ spectra of the final-state strange particles by a Monte Carlo method, which is shown to be in good agreement with the experimental data in most the cases. The kinetic freeze-out parameters are obtained. The present method provides a new tool for studying the spectra of various particles produced in high energy collisions, reflecting more realistically the collision process, which is of great significance to study the formation and properties of the produced particles.

Riemannian Data preprocessing in Machine Learning to focus on QCD color structure - (cross-listed hep-ph)
A. Hammad,Myeonghun Park
Identifying the quantum chromodynamics (QCD) color structure of processes provides additional information to enhance the reach for new physics searches at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Analyses of QCD color structure in the decay process of a boosted particle have been spotted as information becomes well localized in the limited phase space. While these kind of a boosted jet analyses provide an efficient way to identify a color structure, the constrained phase space reduces the number of available data, resulting in a low significance. In this letter, we provide a simple but a novel data preprocessing method using a Riemann sphere to utilize a full phase space by decorrelating QCD structure from a kinematics. We can achieve a statistical stability by enlarging the size of testable data set with focusing on QCD structure effectively. We demonstrate the power of our method at the finite statistics of the LHC Run 2. Our method is complementary to conventional boosted jet analyses in utilizing QCD information over the wide range of a phase space.

N$^3$LO+N$^3$LL QCD improved Higgs pair cross sections - (cross-listed hep-ph)
A. H. Ajjath,Hua-Sheng Shao
We report a new calculation of the soft-gluon threshold resummation for the Higgs boson pair production in the dominant production mode -- gluon-gluon fusion -- up to the next-to-next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic (N$^3$LL) accuracy. After matching N$^3$LL to the next-to-next-to-next-to-leading order (N$^3$LO) QCD calculation in the infinite top quark mass approximation, we show that the central values of the inclusive cross sections are quite stable with respect to N$^3$LO, while the conventional renormalisation and factorisation scale uncertainties are reduced by a factor of two, reaching to the subpercent level. Our study further consolidates the good asymptotic perturbative convergence. After combining with the full top-quark mass dependent next-to-leading order QCD results, our most advanced predictions are presented for both the inclusive total cross sections and the differential invariant mass distributions of the Higgs pair.
