New recursions for tree-level correlators in (Anti) de Sitter space
Connor Armstrong,Humberto Gomez,Renann Lipinski Jusinskas,Arthur Lipstein,Jiajie Mei
We present for the first time classical multiparticle solutions in Anti de Sitter space (AdS) involving scalars, gluons, and gravitons. They are recursively defined through multiparticle currents which reduce to Berends-Giele currents in the flat space limit. This construction exposes a compact definition of tree-level boundary correlators using a general prescription that removes unphysical boundary contributions. Similarly to the flat space perturbiner, a convenient gauge choice leads to a scalar basis for all degrees of freedom, while the tensor structure is exclusively captured by field theory vertices. This provides a fully automated way to compute AdS boundary correlators to any multiplicity and cosmological wavefunction coefficients after Wick-rotating to de Sitter space.

A grounded perspective on New Early Dark Energy using ACT, SPT, and BICEP/Keck - (cross-listed astro-ph.CO)
Juan S. Cruz,Florian Niedermann,Martin S. Sloth
We examine further the ability of the New Early Dark Energy model (NEDE) to resolve the current tension between the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) and local measurements of $H_0$ and the consequences for inflation. We perform new Bayesian analyses, including the current datasets from the ground-based CMB telescopes Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT), the South Pole Telescope (SPT), and the BICEP/Keck telescopes, employing an updated likelihood for the local measurements coming from the S$H_0$ES collaboration. Using the S$H_0$ES prior on $H_0$, the combined analysis with Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations (BAO), Pantheon, Planck and ACT improves the best-fit by $\Delta\chi^2 = -15.9$ with respect to $\Lambda$CDM, favors a non-zero fractional contribution of NEDE, $f_{\rm NEDE} > 0$, by $4.8\sigma$, and gives a best-fit value for the Hubble constant of $H_0 = 72.09$ km/s/Mpc (mean $71.48_{-0.81}^{+0.79}$ with $68\%$ C.L.). A similar analysis using SPT instead of ACT yields consistent results with a $\Delta \chi^2 = - 23.1$ over $\Lambda$CDM, a preference for non-zero $f_{\rm NEDE}$ of $4.7\sigma$ and a best-fit value of $H_0=71.77$ km/s/Mpc (mean $71.43_{-0.84}^{+0.84}$ with $68\%$ C.L.). We also provide the constraints on the inflation parameters $r$ and $n_s$ coming from NEDE, including the BICEP/Keck 2018 data, and show that the allowed upper value on the tensor-scalar ratio is consistent with the $\Lambda$CDM bound, but, as also originally found, with a more blue scalar spectrum implying that the simplest curvaton model is now favored over the Starobinsky inflation model.

Noncommutative hamiltonian for $\star$-gravity, and $\star$-Noether theorems
Leonardo Castellani
We present a covariant canonical formalism for noncommutative gravity, and in general for noncommutative geometric theories defined via a twisted $\star$-wedge product between forms. Noether theorems are generalized to the noncommutative setting, and gauge generators are constructed in a twisted phase space with $\star$-deformed Poisson bracket. This formalism is applied to noncommutative $D=4$ vierbein gravity, and allows to find the canonical generators of the tangent space $\star$-gauge group.

Flux Vacua with Approximate Flat Directions
Michele Cicoli,Matteo Licheri,Ratul Mahanta,Anshuman Maharana
We present a novel method to obtain type IIB flux vacua with flat directions at tree level. We perform appropriate choices of flux quanta that induce relations between the flux superpotential and its derivatives. This method is implemented in toroidal and Calabi-Yau compactifications in the large complex structure limit. Explicit solutions are obtained and classified on the basis of duality equivalences. In the toroidal case we present solutions with N=1 and N=2 supersymmetry and arbitrarily weak coupling. In Calabi-Yaus we find novel perturbatively flat vacua, as well as solutions with non-zero flux superpotential and an axionic flat direction which represent a promising starting point for de Sitter constructions from non-zero F-terms in the complex structure sector. The higher order (perturbative and non-perturbative) effects that can lift these flat directions are discussed. We also outline applications in a wide variety of settings involving the classical Regge growth conjecture, inflation and quintessence, supersymmetry breaking and F-term de Sitter uplifting.

The Quadrupole Moment of Compact Binaries to the Fourth post-Newtonian Order: Relating the Harmonic and Radiative Metrics - (cross-listed gr-qc)
David Trestini,François Larrouturou,Luc Blanchet
Motivated by the completion of the fourth post-Newtonian (4PN) gravitational-wave generation from compact binary systems, we analyze and contrast different constructions of the metric outside an isolated system, using post-Minkowskian expansions. The metric in "harmonic" coordinates has been investigated previously, in particular to compute tails and memory effects. However, it is plagued by powers of the logarithm of the radial distance $r$ when $r\to\infty$ (with $t-r/c=$ const). As a result, the tedious computation of the "tail-of-memory" effect, which enters the gravitational-wave flux at 4PN order, is more efficiently performed in the so-called "radiative" coordinates, which admit a (Bondi-type) expansion at infinity in simple powers of $r^{-1}$, without any logarithms. Here we consider a particular construction, performed order by order in the post-Minkowskian expansion, which directly yields a metric in radiative coordinates. We relate both constructions, and prove that they are physically equivalent as soon as a relation between the "canonical" moments which parametrize the radiative metric, and those parametrizing the harmonic metric, is verified. We provide the appropriate relation for the mass quadrupole moment at 4PN order, which will be crucial when deriving the "tail-of-memory" contribution to the gravitational flux.

Celestial Liouville Theory for Yang-Mills Amplitudes
Stephan Stieberger,Tomasz R. Taylor,Bin Zhu
We consider Yang-Mills theory with the coupling constant and theta angle determined by the vacuum expectation values of a dynamical (complex) dilaton field. We discuss the tree-level N-gluon MHV scattering amplitudes in the presence of a nontrivial background dilaton field and construct the corresponding celestial amplitudes by taking Mellin transforms with respect to the lightcone energies. In this way, we obtain two-dimensional CFT correlators of primary fields on the celestial sphere. We show that the celestial Yang-Mills amplitudes evaluated in the presence of a spherical dilaton shockwave are given by the correlation functions of primary field operators factorized into the holomorphic current operators times the "light" Liouville operators. They are evaluated in the semiclassical limit of Liouville theory (the limit of infinite central charge) and are determined by the classical Liouville field describing metrics on the celestial sphere.

Fluid nature constrains Horndeski gravity - (cross-listed gr-qc)
Marcello Miranda,Daniele Vernieri,Salvatore Capozziello,Valerio Faraoni
The elusive physical nature of Horndeski gravity is elucidated in a new approach depicting this class of theories as a dissipative effective fluid. Requiring the constitutive equations of the latter to be those of a Newtonian fluid restricts the theory to only two disconnected subclasses of "viable" Horndeski gravity. Therefore, a stress-energy tensor of Horndeski effective fluid, linear in the first derivatives of the fluid's 4-velocity, is a sufficient condition for gravitational waves to propagate at light speed. All other Horndeski theories correspond to exotic non-Newtonian effective fluids.

Consistent Kaluza-Klein truncations and two-dimensional gauged supergravity
Guillaume Bossard,Franz Ciceri,Gianluca Inverso,Axel Kleinschmidt
We consider generalized Scherk-Schwarz reductions of E$_9$ exceptional field theory to D=2 space-time dimensions and in particular construct the resulting scalar potential of all gauged supergravities that can be obtained in this way. This provides the first general expression for a multitude of theories with an interesting structure of vacua, covering potentially many new AdS$_2$ cases. As an application, we prove the consistency of the truncation of eleven-dimensional supergravity on $S^8\times S^1$ to SO(9) gauged maximal supergravity. Fluctuations around its supersymmetric SO(9)-invariant vacuum describe holographically the dynamics of interacting D0-branes.

Gross-Neveu-Heisenberg criticality from $2+\boldsymbolε$ expansion - (cross-listed cond-mat.str-el)
Konstantinos Ladovrechis,Shouryya Ray,Tobias Meng,Lukas Janssen
The Gross-Neveu-Heisenberg universality class describes a continuous quantum phase transition between a Dirac semimetal and an antiferromagnetic insulator. Such quantum critical points have originally been discussed in the context of Hubbard models on $\pi$-flux and honeycomb lattices, but more recently also in Bernal-stacked bilayer models, of potential relevance for bilayer graphene. Here, we demonstrate how the critical behavior of this fermionic universality class can be computed within an $\epsilon$ expansion around the lower critical space-time dimension of two. This approach is complementary to the previously studied expansion around the upper critical dimension of four. The crucial technical novelty near the lower critical dimension is the presence of different four-fermion interaction channels at the critical point, which we take into account in a Fierz-complete way. By interpolating between the lower and upper critical dimensions, we obtain improved estimates for the critical exponents in 2+1 space-time dimensions. For the situation relevant to single-layer graphene, we find an unusually small leading-correction-to-scaling exponent, arising from the competition between different interaction channels. This suggests that corrections to scaling may need to be taken into account when comparing analytical estimates with numerical data from finite-size extrapolations.

Probing ultralight scalar, vector and tensor dark matter with pulsar timing arrays - (cross-listed astro-ph.CO)
Caner Unal,Federico R. Urban,Ely D. Kovetz
Pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) are sensitive to oscillations in the gravitational potential along the line-of-sight due to ultralight particle pressure. We calculate the probing power of PTAs for ultralight bosons across all frequencies, from those larger than the inverse observation time to those smaller than the inverse distance to the pulsar. We show that since the signal amplitude grows faster compared to the degradation in PTA sensitivity at frequencies smaller than inverse observation time, the discovery potential can be extended towards lower masses by over three decades, maintaining high precision. We demonstrate that existing 15-year PTA data can robustly detect or rule out an ultralight component in the mass range $10^{-26}\!-\!10^{-23}\,{\rm eV}$ with fraction down to percent level of the total dark matter. Non-detection, together with other bounds in different mass regimes, will imply that ultralight scalar/axion can comprise at most $1-10\%$ of dark matter in the $10^{-30}\!-\!10^{-17}$ eV regime. With 30 years of observation, current PTAs can extend the reach down to $0.1 \%$, while next-generation PTAs such as SKA can probe the $0.01\%$ level. We also generalize the analysis and derive predictions for probing ultralight vector (i.e. dark photon) and spin-2 dark matter components.

Celestial amplitude for 2d theory
Sarthak Duary
We explore celestial amplitude corresponding to $2d$ bulk $S$-matrix. We consider scalar particles with identical mass and show that the celestial amplitude becomes the fourier transform of the $2d$ $S$-matrix written in the rapidity variable. We translate the crossing and unitarity conditions into the conditions on the celestial amplitude. For the $2d$ Sinh-Gordon model, we calculate the celestial amplitude perturbatively in coupling constant and check that the crossing and unitarity conditions are satisfied for the celestial amplitude. Imposing the crossing and unitarity conditions to the celestial amplitude, we want to find amplitudes to the higher order in perturbation theory from the lower order i.e., to provide a "\textit{proof of principle}" to show we can apply the bootstrap idea to the celestial amplitude. We find that imposing the crossing and unitarity conditions is not enough for bootstrapping celestial amplitude, there is an extra term which can't be fixed by the crossing and unitarity conditions. We also study the gravitational dressing condition in $2d$ QFT for massless particles in celestial space and see that for the gravitationally dressed celestial amplitude, the poles on the right half-plane get erased for several ansatzes.

Reconstruction of spectra and an algorithm based on the theorems of Darboux and Puiseux
Sašo Grozdanov,Timotej Lemut
Assuming only a known dispersion relation of a single mode in the spectrum of a two-point function in some quantum field theory, we investigate when and how the reconstruction of the complete spectrum of physical excitations is possible. In particular, we develop a constructive algorithm based on the theorems of Darboux and Puiseux that allows for such a reconstruction of all modes connected by level-crossings. For concreteness, we focus on theories in which the known mode is a gapless excitation described by the hydrodynamic gradient expansion, known at least to some (preferably high) order. We first apply the algorithm to a simple algebraic example and then to the transverse momentum excitations in the holographic theory that describes a stack of M2 branes and includes momentum diffusion as its gapless excitation.

6D (2,0) Bootstrap with soft-Actor-Critic
Gergely Kántor,Vasilis Niarchos,Constantinos Papageorgakis,Paul Richmond
We study numerically the 6D (2,0) superconformal bootstrap using the soft-Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm as a stochastic optimizer. We focus on the four-point functions of scalar superconformal primaries in the energy-momentum multiplet. Starting from the supergravity limit, we perform searches for adiabatically varied central charges and derive two curves for a collection of 80 CFT data (70 of these data correspond to unprotected long multiplets and 10 to protected short multiplets). We conjecture that the two curves capture the A- and D-series (2,0) theories. Our results are competitive when compared to the existing bounds coming from standard numerical bootstrap methods, and data obtained using the OPE inversion formula. With this paper we are also releasing our Python implementation of the SAC algorithm, BootSTOP. The paper discusses the main functionality features of this package.

Denominator Regularization in Quantum Field Theory
W. A. Horowitz
We propose a novel regularization scheme in quantum field theory, denominator regularization (den reg). As simple to apply as dimensional regularization, and similarly compatible with a minimal subtraction renormalization scheme, den reg manifestly 1) maintains Lorentz invariance, 2) maintains gauge invariance, 3) maintains supersymmetry, 4) correctly predicts the axial anomaly, and 5) yields Green functions that satisfy the Callan-Symanzik equation. Den reg also naturally enables regularization in asymmetric spacetimes, finite spacetimes, curved spacetimes, and in thermal field theory.

CFTs with $U(m)\times U(n)$ Global Symmetry in 3D and the Chiral Phase Transition of QCD
Stefanos R. Kousvos,Andreas Stergiou
Conformal field theories (CFTs) with $U(m)\times U(n)$ global symmetry in $d=3$ dimensions have been studied for years due to their potential relevance to the chiral phase transition of quantum chromodynamics (QCD). In this work such CFTs are analyzed in $d=4-\varepsilon$ and $d=3$. This includes perturbative computations in the $\varepsilon$ and large-$n$ expansions as well non-perturbative ones with the numerical conformal bootstrap. New perturbative results are presented and a variety of non-perturbative bootstrap bounds are obtained in $d=3$. Various features of the bounds obtained for large values of $n$ disappear for low values of $n$ (keeping $m<n$ fixed), a phenomenon which is attributed to a transition of the corresponding fixed points to the non-unitary regime. Numerous bootstrap bounds are found that are saturated by large-$n$ results, even in the absence of any features in the bounds. A double scaling limit is also observed, for $m$ and $n$ large with $m/n$ fixed, both in perturbation theory as well as in the numerical bootstrap. For the case of two-flavor massless QCD existing bootstrap evidence is reproduced that the chiral phase transition with effectively restored axial $U(1)$ symmetry may be second order, albeit associated to a universality class unrelated to the one usually discussed in the $\varepsilon$ expansion. Similar evidence is found for the case of three-flavor massless QCD, where we observe a pronounced kink.

Periods, the meromorphic 3D-index and the Turaev--Viro invariant - (cross-listed math.GT)
Stavros Garoufalidis,Campbell Wheeler
The 3D-index of Dimofte-Gaiotto-Gukov is an interesting collection of $q$-series with integer coefficients parametrised by a pair of integers and associated to a 3-manifold with torus boundary. In this note, we explain the structure of the asymptotic expansions of the 3D-index when $q=e^{2\pi i\tau}$ and $\tau$ tends to zero (to all orders and with exponentially small terms included), and discover two phenomena: (a) when $\tau$ tends to zero on a ray near the positive real axis, the horizontal asymptotics of the meromorphic 3D-index match to all orders with the asymptotics of the Turaev-Viro invariant of a knot, in particular explaining the Volume Conjecture of Chen-Yang from first principles, (b) when $\tau \to 0$ on the positive imaginary axis, the vertical asymptotics of the 3D-index involves periods of a plane curve (the $A$-polynomial), as opposed to algebraic numbers, explaining some predictions of Hodgson-Kricker-Siejakowski and leading to conjectural identities between periods of the $A$-polynomial of a knot and integrals of the Euler beta-function.

Emergent bulk gauge field in random tensor networks
Xiao-Liang Qi
Random tensor network states are toy models for holographic duality, which have entanglement properties determined by graph geometry. In this paper, we propose a generalization of the random tensor network states which describe an ensemble of states preserving a given global symmetry. We show that Renyi entropy for this family of states can be described by a quantum extremal surface formula, with corrections to the area law term determined by a bulk gauge theory wavefunction. This provides a toy model of the correspondence between boundary global symmetry and bulk gauge symmetry in holographic duality. We discuss the boundary physical consequences of the bulk deconfined and confined phases.

Neutrino pair condensate and its application to cosmology and astrophysics - (cross-listed hep-ph)
M. Yoshimura
Left-handed neutrinos interact attractively by Z-boson exchange. The Ginzburg-Landau mean field calculation and the Bogoliubov transformation suggest that the attractive force leads to neutrino pair condensate and neutrino super-fluidity. Neutrinos, as defined by quasi-particle in the super-fluid phase, behave as massless fermions. When the result of super-fluid formation is applied to the early universe, horizon scale pair condensate may become a component of dark energy. A further accretion of other fermions from thermal cosmic medium gives a seed of primordial neutron stars consisting of proton, neutron, electron, and neutrino in beta-equilibrium, surrounded by left-handed neutrino pair condensate. This possibility may provide a mechanism of giving a part or the whole of the dark matter in the present universe, if a properly chosen small fraction condenses to neutrino super-fluid and primordial neutron star not to over-close the universe. The proposal can be verified by measuring neutrino burst at primordial neutron star formation and by detecting super-fluid relic neutrinos in atomic experiments at laboratories.

On observational signatures of multi-fractional theory - (cross-listed gr-qc)
Mahnaz Asghari,Ahmad Sheykhi
We study the multi-fractional theory with $q$-derivatives, where the multi-fractional measure is considered to be in the time direction. The evolution of power spectra and also the expansion history of the universe are investigated in the $q$-derivatives theory. According to the matter power spectra diagrams, the structure growth would increase in the multi-fractional model, expressing incompatibility with low redshift measurements of large scale structures. Furthermore, concerning the diagrams of Hubble parameter evolution, there is a reduction in the value of Hubble constant which conflicts with local cosmological constraints. We also explore the multi-fractional model with current observational data, principally Planck 2018, weak lensing, supernovae, baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO), and redshift-space distortions (RSD) measurements. Numerical analysis reveals that the degeneracy between multi-fractional parameters makes them remain unconstrained under observations.

Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity and near-extremal BTZ thermodynamics
Rohan R. Poojary
We study the near horizon 2d gravity theory which captures the near extremal thermodynamics of BTZ with excess mass $\delta M$ and excess angular momentum $\delta J =\mathcal{L}\, \delta M$ over extremality. We find that the Jackiw-Teitelboim theory is able to capture such departures from extremality with an additional parameter $\mathcal{L}$ relating it to the near extremal BTZ configuration. We are able to show this by obtaining new simultaneous near horizon near extremal limits of the BTZ geometry parametrized by $\mathcal{L}$. The resulting Jackiw-Teitelboim theory captures the near extremal thermodynamics of such BTZ geometries provided we identify the temperature $T^{(2)}_H$ of the $AdS_2$ geometry in the Jackiw-Teitelboim theory to be $T^{(2)}_H=T_H/(1-\mu\,\mathcal{L})$ where $T_H$ is the BTZ temperature and $\mu$ its chemical potential with $\mu\,\mathcal{L}<1$.

Energy corrections of the two dimensional Dunkl harmonic oscillator in the Non-Commutative phase-space
S. Hassanabadi,P. Sedaghatnia,W. S. Chung,B. C. Lütfüoğlu,J. Kříž,H. Hassanabadi
In this paper, we examine the harmonic oscillator problem in non-commutative phase space (NCPS) by using the Dunkl derivative instead of the habitual one. After defining the Hamilton operator, we use the perturbation method to derive the binding energy eigenvalues. We find eigenfunctions that correspond to these eigenvalues in terms of the Laguerre functions. We observe that the Dunkl-Harmonic Oscillator (DHO) in the NCPS differs from the ordinary one in the context of providing additional information on the even and odd parities. Therefore, we conclude that working with the Dunkl operator could be more appropriate because of its rich content.

Automatic structural optimization of tree tensor networks - (cross-listed cond-mat.stat-mech)
Toshiya Hikihara,Hiroshi Ueda,Kouichi Okunishi,Kenji Harada,Tomotoshi Nishino
Tree tensor network (TTN) provides an essential theoretical framework for the practical simulation of quantum many-body systems, where the network structure defined by the connectivity of the isometry tensors plays a crucial role in improving its approximation accuracy. In this paper, we propose a TTN algorithm that enables us to automatically optimize the network structure by local reconnections of isometries to suppress the bipartite entanglement entropy on their legs. The algorithm can be seamlessly implemented to such a conventional TTN approach as density-matrix renormalization group. We apply the algorithm to the inhomogeneous antiferromagnetic Heisenberg spin chain having a hierarchical spatial distribution of the interactions. We then demonstrate that the entanglement structure embedded in the ground-state of the system can be efficiently visualized as a perfect binary tree in the optimized TTN. Possible improvements and applications of the algorithm are also discussed.

Quantum current dissipation in superconducting strings and vortons - (cross-listed hep-ph)
Yoshihiko Abe,Yu Hamada,Kota Saji,Koichi Yoshioka
In this work, the current stability is discussed for cosmic strings with the bosonic superconductivity. A non-vanishing curvature of string generally induce the quantum instability of the current-carrying particle. Its decay rates are explored for various types of model parameters, curved string shapes, and decay processes. As a cosmological application, the stability is examined for superconducting strings in the string network and also for cosmic vortons by evaluating their cosmological evolution. The zero mode and hence the vorton cannot be stable in various cases, e.g., with a hierarchy between the current-carrying particle mass off the string and the string tension or with sizable couplings of the current-carrying particle to light species such as the Standard Model particles.

Modular conjugations in 2D conformal field theory and holographic bit threads
Mihail Mintchev,Erik Tonni
We study the geometric action of some modular conjugations in two dimensional (2D) conformal field theories. We investigate the bipartition given by an interval when the system is in the ground state, either on the line or on the circle, and in the thermal Gibbs state on the line. We find that the restriction of the corresponding inversion maps to a spatial slice is obtained also in the gauge/gravity correspondence through the geodesic bit threads in a constant time slice of the dual static asymptotically AdS background. For a CFT in the thermal state on the line, the modular conjugation suggests the occurrence of a second world which can be related through the geodesic bit threads to the horizon of the BTZ black brane background. An inversion map is constructed also for the massless Dirac fermion in the ground state and on the line bipartite by the union of two disjoint intervals.

Tunneling Potential Actions from Canonical Transformations
José R. Espinosa,Ryusuke Jinno,Thomas Konstandin
A new formulation for obtaining the tunneling action for vacuum decay based on the so-called tunneling potential was developed recently. In the original derivation, the new action was obtained by requiring that its variation led to the correct equations of motion and the same value for the action as evaluated on the Euclidean bounce. We present an alternative derivation of the tunneling potential action via canonical transformations. We discuss both single-field and multi-field cases as well as the case with gravity. We also comment on the possible application of the new approach to the calculation of the functional determinant prefactor in the tunneling rate.

Entanglement evolution after a global quench across a conformal defect - (cross-listed cond-mat.stat-mech)
Luca Capizzi,Viktor Eisler
We study the evolution of entanglement after a global quench in a one-dimensional quantum system with a localized impurity. For systems described by a conformal field theory, the entanglement entropy between the two regions separated by the defect grows linearly in time. Introducing the notion of boundary twist fields, we show how the slope of this growth can be related to the effective central charge that emerges in the study of ground-state entropy in the presence of the defect. On the other hand, we also consider a particular lattice realization of the quench in a free-fermion chain with a conformal defect. Starting from a gapped initial state, we obtain the slope via a quasiparticle ansatz and observe small discrepancies between the field theory and lattice results, which persist even in the limit of a vanishing gap.

UV/IR Mixing, Causal Diamonds and the Electroweak Hierarchy Problem - (cross-listed hep-ph)
Thomas W. Kephart,Heinrich Päs
UV/IR Mixing has been proposed as a possible explanation of the hierarchy problem, i.e. the apparent unnaturally large hierarchy between the electroweak and the Planck scales. Here we suggest that UV/IR mixing may not be a new, exotic phenomenon but rather a generic feature of entangled systems in quantum mechanics. Based on how UV/IR mixing has been employed in the Cohen-Kaplan-Nelson bound and advocated as a solution to the cosmological constant problem, we argue that in the Higgs system causal diamonds replace the cosmic horizon as an IR bound for effective field theory and show how this ansatz may help to explain the large hierarchy between the electroweak and the Planck scale.

Carrollian hydrodynamics from symmetries
Laurent Freidel,Puttarak Jai-akson
In this work, we revisit Carrollian hydrodynamics, a type of non-Lorentzian hydrodynamics which has recently gained increasing attentions due to its underlying connection with dynamics of spacetime near null boundaries, and we aim at exploring symmetries associated with conservation laws of Carrollian fluids. With an elaborate construction of Carroll geometries, we generalize the Randers-Papapetrou metric by incorporating the fluid velocity field and the sub-leading components of the metric into our considerations and we argue that these two additional fields are compulsory phase space variables in the derivation of Carrollian hydrodynamics from symmetries. We then present a new notion of symmetry, called the near-Carrollian diffeomorphism, and demonstrate that this symmetry consistently yields a complete set of Carrollian hydrodynamic equations. Furthermore, due to the presence of the new phase space fields, our results thus generalize those already presented in the previous literatures. Lastly, the Noether charges associated with the near-Carrollian diffeomorphism and their time evolutions are also discussed.

The Branes Behind Generalized Symmetry Operators
Jonathan J. Heckman,Max Hübner,Ethan Torres,Hao Y. Zhang
The modern approach to $m$-form global symmetries in a $d$-dimensional quantum field theory (QFT) entails specifying dimension $d-m-1$ topological generalized symmetry operators which non-trivially link with $m$-dimensional defect operators. In QFTs engineered via string constructions on a non-compact geometry $X$, these defects descend from branes wrapped on non-compact cycles which extend from a localized source / singularity to the boundary $\partial X$. The generalized symmetry operators which link with these defects arise from magnetic dual branes wrapped on cycles in $\partial X$. This provides a systematic way to read off various properties of such topological operators, including their worldvolume topological field theories, and the resulting fusion rules. We illustrate these general features in the context of 6D superconformal field theories, where we use the F-theory realization of these theories to read off the worldvolume theory on the generalized symmetry operators. Line-like defects which are charged under a suitable 1-form symmetry detect a non-invertible fusion rule for these operators. We also sketch how similar considerations hold for related systems.
