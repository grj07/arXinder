The dark side of the proton
Matthew McCullough, James Moore, Maria Ubiali
  We study the sensitivity of the High-Luminosity LHC to a light baryonic dark photon B, primarily coupled to quarks, as a constituent of the proton. This is achieved by allowing for a dark photon parton distribution function (PDF) in the PDF evolution equations. Depending on the mass and coupling of the dark photon, the evolution of standard quark and gluon PDFs is distorted to varying degrees. By analysing the effect of the dark photon on the tails of Drell-Yan invariant mass distributions, we demonstrate the potential of the LHC in determining competitive bounds on dark photon parameter space. \\ ( https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.12628 ,  172kb)

Hadrophilic Light Dark Matter from the Atmosphere
Carlos A. Arg\"uelles, V\'ictor Mu\~noz, Ian M. Shoemaker, Volodymyr  Takhistov
  Light sub-GeV dark matter (DM) constitutes an underexplored target, beyond the optimized sensitivity of typical direct DM detection experiments. We comprehensively investigate hadrophilic light DM produced from cosmic-ray collisions with the atmosphere. The resulting relativistic DM, originating from meson decays, can be efficiently observed in variety of experiments, such as XENON1T. We include for the first time decays of $\eta$, $\eta^{\prime}$ and $K^+$ mesons, leading to improved limits for DM masses above few hundred MeV. We incorporate an exact treatment of the DM attenuation in Earth and demonstrate that nuclear form factor effects can significantly impact the resulting testable DM parameter space. Further, we establish projections for upcoming experiments, such as DARWIN, over a wide range of DM masses below the GeV scale. \\ ( https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.12630 ,  211kb)

$\varepsilon'/\varepsilon$ in the Standard Model and Beyond: 2021
Andrzej J. Buras
  The present status of the ratio $\varepsilon'/\varepsilon$ in the Standard Model (SM) is summarized. In particular we stress the differences between three approaches that attempt to calculate $\varepsilon'/\varepsilon$ within the SM: Lattice QCD, Dual QCD and Chiral Perturbation Theory. As presently there is still a significant room left for new physics (NP) contributions, we summarize the present status of the technology that has been recently developed with the goal to analyze $\varepsilon'/\varepsilon$ and its correlations with other observables within the Weak Effective Theory (WET) and the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). We also make a few comments on the interpretation of the main dynamics behind the $\Delta I=1/2$ rule in $K\to\pi\pi$ decays. \\ ( https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.12632 ,  87kb)

Towards a Deep Learning Model for Hadronization
Aishik Ghosh, Xiangyang Ju, Benjamin Nachman, Andrzej Siodmok
  Hadronization is a complex quantum process whereby quarks and gluons become hadrons. The widely-used models of hadronization in event generators are based on physically-inspired phenomenological models with many free parameters. We propose an alternative approach whereby neural networks are used instead. Deep generative models are highly flexible, differentiable, and compatible with Graphical Processing Unit (GPUs). We make the first step towards a data-driven machine learning-based hadronization model by replacing a compont of the hadronization model within the Herwig event generator (cluster model) with a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). We show that a GAN is capable of reproducing the kinematic properties of cluster decays. Furthermore, we integrate this model into Herwig to generate entire events that can be compared with the output of the public Herwig simulator as well as with $e^+e^-$ data. \\ ( https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.12660 ,  759kb)

Triple Higgs Couplings in the 2HDM: The Complete Picture
F. Arco, S. Heinemeyer, and M.J. Herrero
  The measurement of the triple Higgs coupling is one of the main tasks of the (HL-)LHC and future lepton colliders. Similarly, triple Higgs couplings involving BSM Higgs bosons are of high interest. Within the framework of Two Higgs Doublet Models (2HDM) we investigate the allowed ranges for all triple Higgs couplings involving at least one light, SM-like Higgs boson. We present newly the allowed ranges for 2HDM type~III and~IV and update the results within the type~I and~II. We take into account theoretical constraints from unitarity and stability, experimental constraints from direct BSM Higgs-boson searches, measurements of the rates of the SM-like Higgs-boson at the LHC, as well as flavor observables and electroweak precision data. For the SM-type triple Higgs coupling w.r.t. its SM value, $\lambda_{hhh}/\lambda_{hhh}^\mathrm{SM}$, we find allowed intervals of $\sim [-0.5,1.3]$ in type~I and $\sim [0.5,1.0]$ in the other Yukawa types. These allowed ranges have important implications for the experimental determination of this coupling at future collider experiments. We find the coupling $\lambda_{hhH}$ between $\sim -1.5$ and $\sim +1.5$ in the four Yukawa types. For the triple Higgs couplings involving two heavy neutral Higgs bosons, $\lambda_{hHH}$ and $\lambda_{hAA}$ we find values between $\sim -0.5$ and $\sim 16$, and between $\sim -1$ and $\sim 32$ for $\lambda_{hH^+H^-}$. These potentially large values could lead to strongly enhanced production of two Higgs-bosons at the HL-LHC or high-energy lepton colliders. \\ ( https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.12684 ,  63887kb)

Rocks, Water and Noble Liquids: Unfolding the Flavor Contents of  Supernova Neutrinos
Sebastian Baum, Francesco Capozzi, Shunsaku Horiuchi
  Measuring core-collapse supernova neutrinos, both from individual supernovae within the Milky Way and from past core collapses throughout the Universe (the diffuse supernova neutrino background, or DSNB), is one of the main goals of current and next generation neutrino experiments. Detecting the heavy-lepton flavor (muon and tau types, collectively $\nu_x$) component of the flux is particularly challenging due to small statistics and large backgrounds. While the next galactic neutrino burst will be observed in a plethora of neutrino channels, allowing to measure a small number of $\nu_x$ events, only upper limits are anticipated for the diffuse $\nu_x$ flux even after decades of data taking with conventional detectors. However, paleo-detectors could measure the time-integrated flux of neutrinos from galactic core-collapse supernovae via flavor-blind neutral current interactions. In this work, we show how combining a measurement of the average galactic core-collapse supernova flux with paleo detectors and measurements of the DSNB electron-type neutrino fluxes with the next-generation water Cherenkov detector Hyper-Kamiokande and the liquid noble gas detector DUNE will allow to determine the mean supernova $\nu_x$ flux parameters with precision of order ten percent. \\ ( https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.12696 ,  1095kb)

  This is a Snowmass white paper on the utility of existing and future superconducting cavities to probe fundamental physics. Superconducting radio frequency (SRF) cavity technology has seen tremendous progress in the past decades, as a tool for accelerator science. With advances spear-headed by the SQMS center at Fermilab, they are now being brought to the quantum regime becoming a tool in quantum science thanks to the high degree of coherence. The same high quality factor can be leveraged in the search for new physics, including searches for new particles, dark matter, including the QCD axion, and gravitational waves. We survey some of the physics opportunities and the required directions of R&D. Given the already demonstrated integration of SRF cavities in large accelerator systems, this R&D may enable larger scale searches by dedicated experiments. \\ ( https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.12714 ,  7712kb)

A new method for measurement of the Michel parameters that describe the  daughter muon polarization in the $\tau^- \to \mu^- \bar{\nu}_\mu\nu_\tau$  decay
D. Bodrov, P. Pakhlov
An application of the suggested method in the existing and future experiments at $e^+e^-$ colliders is considered. We have performed a feasibility study for the future Super Charm-Tau Factory and Belle II experiments. For the first one, the sensitivity to the Michel parameters $\xi'$, $\xi''$, $\eta''$, $\alpha'/A$, and $\beta'/A$ is estimated. For the latter, only one Michel parameter, $\xi'$, for which the sensitivity is maximum, is considered. \\ ( https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.12743 ,  188kb)

Application of deep learning in top pair and single top quark production  at the LHC
Ijaz Ahmed, Anwar Zada, Muhammad Waqas, M. U. Ashraf
  We demonstrate the performance of a very efficient tagger applies on hadronically decaying top quark pairs as signal based on deep neural network algorithms and compares with the QCD multi-jet background events. A significant enhancement of performance in boosted top quark events is observed with our limited computing resources. We also compare modern machine learning approaches and perform a multivariate analysis of boosted top-pair as well as single top quark production through weak interaction at $\sqrt{s}=$14 TeV proton-proton Collider. The most relevant known background processes are incorporated. Through the techniques of Boosted Decision Tree (BDT), likelihood and Multlayer Perceptron (MLP) the analysis is trained to observe the performance in comparison with the conventional cut based and count approach. \\ ( https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.12871 ,  1281kb)

The SAGEX Review on Scattering Amplitudes, Chapter 4: Multi-loop Feynman  Integrals
Johannes Bl\"umlein and Carsten Schneider
  The analytic integration and simplification of multi-loop Feynman integrals to special functions and constants plays an important role to perform higher order perturbative calculations in the Standard Model of elementary particles. In this survey article the most recent and relevant computer algebra and special function algorithms are presented that are currently used or that may play an important role to perform such challenging precision calculations in the future. They are discussed in the context of analytic zero, single and double scale calculations in the Quantum Field Theories of the Standard Model and effective field theories, also with classical applications. These calculations play a central role in the analysis of precision measurements at present and future colliders to obtain ultimate information for fundamental physics. \\ ( https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.13015 ,  158kb)

Bremsstrahlung in chiral medium: anomalous contribution to the  Bethe-Heitler formula
Jeremy Hansen, Kirill Tuchin
  We investigate photon bremsstrahlung in chiral media. The chiral medium response to the magnetic field is described by the chiral magnetic current $ j= b_0 B$, where $b_0$ is the chiral magnetic conductivity. This current modifies the photon dispersion relation producing a resonance in the scattering amplitude. We show that the resonant contribution is proportional to the magnetic moment $\mu$ of the target nucleus. We analytically compute the corresponding cross section. We argue that the anomalous contribution is enhanced by a factor $b_0^2/\Gamma^2$, where $\Gamma$ is a width of the resonance related to the chiral magnetic instability of the electromagnetic field. The most conspicuous feature of the anomalous contribution to the photon spectrum is the emergence of the knee-like structure at photon energies proportional to $b_0$. We argue that the phenomenological significance of the anomalous terms depends on the magnitude of the ratio of $b_0$ to the projectile fermion mass. \\ ( https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.13134 ,  85kb)

Emergence of periodic in magnetic moment effective QED action
Stefan Evans and Johann Rafelski
  We evaluate for the inhomogeneous static electric Sauter step potential the imaginary part of the emerging homogeneous in electric field effective Euler-Heisenberg-Schwinger action sourced by vacuum fluctuations of a charged particle with magnetic moment of arbitrary strength. The result is convergent for all values of gyromagnetic ratio $g$, periodic in $g$, with a cusp at $g=2$. We consider the relation to the QED beta-function which is also found to be periodic in $g$. We confirm presence of asymptotic freedom conditions using this novel method and document a wider range of $g$-values for which asymptotic freedom is present. \\ ( https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.13145 ,  227kb)

Mounting evidence for a 95 GeV Higgs boson
Thomas Biek\"otter, Sven Heinemeyer, Georg Weiglein
  In 2018 CMS reported an excess in the light Higgs-boson search in the diphoton decay mode at about 95GeV based on Run 1 and first year Run 2 data. The combined local significance of the excess was $2.8\,\sigma$. The excess is compatible with the limits obtained in the ATLAS searches from the diphoton search channel. Recently, CMS reported another local excess with a significance of $3.1\,\sigma$ in the light Higgs-boson search in the di-tau final state, which is compatible with the interpretation of a Higgs boson with a mass of about 95GeV. We show that the observed results can be interpreted as manifestations of a Higgs boson in the Two-Higgs Doublet Model with an additional real singlet (N2HDM). We find that the lightest Higgs boson of the N2HDM can fit both excesses simultaneously, while the second-lightest state is such that it satisfies the Higgs-boson measurements at 125GeV, and the full Higgs-boson sector is compatible with all Higgs exclusion bounds from the searches at LEP, the Tevatron and the LHC as well as with other theoretical and experimental constraints. Finally, we demonstrate that it is furthermore possible to accommodate the excesses observed by CMS in the two search channels together with a local $2.3\,\sigma$ excess in the $b \bar b$ final state observed at LEP in the same mass range. \\ ( https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.13180 ,  1481kb)

  Electron Ion Collider (EIC) is a particle accelerator facility planned for construction at Brookhaven National Laboratory on Long Island, New York by the United States Department of Energy. EIC will provide capabilities of colliding beams of polarized electrons with polarized beams of proton and light ions. EIC will be one of the largest and most sophisticated new accelerator facilities worldwide, and the only new large-scale accelerator facility planned for construction in the United States in the next few decades. The versatility, resolving power and intensity of EIC will present many new opportunities to address some of the crucial and fundamental open scientific questions in particle physics.

A global analysis of $b \to s \ell \ell$ data in heavy and light $Z'$  models
Ashutosh Kumar Alok, Neetu Raj Singh Chundawat, Shireen Gangal and  Dinesh Kumar
  We perform a model-independent global fit to all $b \to s \ell \ell$ data in the light of recent measurements of the lepton flavour universality violating (LFUV) observables $R_{K_S^0}$ and $R_{K^{*+}}$ as well as the updated measurements of observables in $B_s \to \phi \mu^+ \mu^-$ decay, by the LHCb collaboration. We obtain new physics (NP) solutions to the current anomalies in the data, assuming NP in the muon sector only. We find that the 1D NP scenarios $C_9^{\rm NP} <0 $ and $C_{9}^{\rm NP}=-C_{10}^{\rm NP}$ continue to be the most favoured ones. However, the significance of the then favoured scenario $C_{9}^{\rm NP}=-C'_{9}$ has reduced and the updated data now marginally prefers $C_{10}^{\rm NP}$ scenario over $C_{9}^{\rm NP}=-C'_{9}$. The 2D scenarios $(C_9^{\rm NP}, C_{10}^{\prime} )$, $(C_9^{\rm NP}, C_{9}^{\prime} )$ and $(C_9^{\rm NP}, C_{10}^{\rm NP} )$, continue to be favoured by the data in the listed order. We also analyse generic TeV scale $Z'$ models which can generate the favored 1D scenarios, $C_9^{\rm NP} $ and $C_9^{\rm NP} = -C_{10}^{\rm NP}$ along with the 2D NP scenarios $(C_9^{\rm NP}, C_{9}^{\prime} )$ and $(C_9^{\rm NP}, C_{10}^{\rm NP} )$. Using the additional constraints from $B_s -\bar{B_s}$ mixing and neutrino trident data, we find that all four models provide an equally good fit to the data. Further, we consider a model with a 25 MeV $Z'$ that couples to muons and has a $q^2$ dependent $b - s$ coupling. We also study the implications of the current data on the LFUV observable $R_{\phi}$, $Q_{4,5}$ along with $R_{K^{(*)}}$ in the high $q^2$. We find that a precise measurements of these observables can provide a good discrimination between a few favored model-independent solutions, and have a potential to disentangle different heavy and light $Z'$ scenarios considered in this work. \\ ( https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.13217 ,  491kb)

Schwarzschild-like Topological Solitons
Ibrahima Bah, Pierre Heidmann and Peter Weck
  We construct the first class of topological solitons in gravity that are supported by internal electromagnetic flux with vanishing net charges. The solutions are obtained in a six-dimensional Einstein-Maxwell theory with a three-form flux, and admit an uplift to type IIB supergravity on T$^4$. They are asymptotic to a torus fibration over four-dimensional Minkowski spacetime. An interesting class corresponds to solitons with a BPS particle and its anti-BPS partner held apart by a vacuum bubble. In type IIB, they correspond to bound states of BPS and anti-BPS D1-D5 extremal black holes. These metrics are a particular limit of a larger class of axially symmetric metrics that we construct and that describe smooth horizonless topological solitons. They correspond to bound states of three non-BPS bubbles on a line. An important achievement is that the outer bubbles can carry arbitrary D1-D5 charges that we can tune to vanishing net charges. We discuss their properties and compare them to a four-dimensional Schwarzschild black hole of the same mass. We show that they have a long throat with a large redshift, and that they are ultra-compact with a characteristic size of 1.52 times the Schwarzschild radius. \\ ( https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.12625 ,  2797kb)

Random Field $\phi^3$ Model and Parisi-Sourlas Supersymmetry
Apratim Kaviraj, Emilio Trevisani
  We use the RG framework set up in arXiv:2009.10087 to explore the $\phi^3$ theory with a random field interaction. According to the Parisi-Sourlas conjecture this theory admits a fixed point with emergent supersymmetry which is related to the pure Lee-Yang CFT in two less dimensions. We study the model using replica trick and Cardy variables in $d=8-\epsilon$ where the RG flow is perturbative. Allowed perturbations are singlets under the $S_n$ symmetry that permutes the $n$ replicas. These are decomposed into operators with different scaling dimensions: the lowest dimensional part, `leader', controls the RG flow in the IR; the other operators, `followers', can be neglected. The leaders are classified into: susy-writable, susy-null and non-susy-writable according to their mixing properties. We construct low lying leaders and compute the anomalous dimensions of a number of them. We argue that there is no operator that can destabilize the SUSY RG flow in $d\le 8$. This agrees with the well known numerical result for critical exponents of Branched Polymers (which are in the same universality class as the random field $\phi^3$ model) that match the ones of the pure Lee-Yang fixed point according to dimensional reduction in all $2\le d\le 8$. Hence this is a second strong check of the RG framework that was previously shown to correctly predict loss of dimensional reduction in random field Ising model. \\ ( https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.12629 ,  4886kb)

Global anomalies in 8d supergravity
Yasunori Lee, Kazuya Yonekura
  We study gauge and gravitational anomalies of fermions and 2-form fields on eight-dimensional spin manifolds. Possible global gauge anomalies are classified by spin bordism groups $\Omega^{\text{spin}}_9(BG)$ which we determine by spectral sequence techniques, and we also identify their explicit generator manifolds. It turns out that a fermion in the adjoint representation of any simple Lie group, and a gravitino in $8d$ $\mathcal{N}=1$ supergravity theory, have anomalies. We discuss how a 2-form field, which also appears in supergravity, produces anomalies which cancel against these fermion anomalies in a certain class of supergravity theories. In another class of theories, the anomaly of the gravitino is not cancelled by the 2-form field, but by topological degrees of freedom. It gives a restriction on the topology of spacetime manifolds which is not visible at the level of differential-form analysis. \\ ( https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.12631 ,  43kb)

Anti-brane uplift instability from goldstino condensation

  We investigate the possible appearance of composite states of the goldstino in models with four-dimensional non-linear supersymmetry and we provide a description of their dynamics in terms of a K\"ahler potential and a superpotential. Our analysis shows that the critical point corresponding to the Volkov-Akulov model is unstable. Similarly, we find that the uplifted stable de Sitter critical point of the KKLT model is shifted and acquires a tachyonic instability. Our findings indicate the existence of a potentially dangerous instability shared by all anti-brane uplifts. \\ ( https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.12636 ,  330kb)

Gauge theory models on $\kappa$-Minkowski space: Results and prospects
Kilian Hersent, Jean-Christophe Wallet
  Recent results obtained in $\kappa$-Poincar\'e invariant gauge theories on $\kappa$-Minkowski space are reviewed and commented. A Weyl quantization procedure can be applied to convolution algebras to derive a convenient star product. For such a star product, gauge invariant polynomial action functional depending on the curvature exists only in 5 dimensions. The corresponding noncommutative differential calculus and the related connection are twisted together with the BRST structure linked to the gauge invariance. Phenomenological consequences stemming from the existence of one extra dimension are commented. Some consequences of the appearance of a non-vanishing one-loop tadpole upon BRST gauge-fixing are discussed. \\ ( https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.12706 ,  33kb)

On the off-shell superfield Lagrangian formulation of $4D$,  $\mathcal{N}{=}\,1$ supersymmetric infinite spin theory
I.L. Buchbinder, S.A. Fedoruk, A.P. Isaev, V.A. Krykhtin
  We develop a complete off-shell Lagrangian description of the free $4D, {\cal N}=1$ supersymmetric theory of infinite spin. Bosonic and fermionic fields are formulated in terms of spin-tensor fields with dotted and undotted indices. The corresponding Lagrangians for bosonic and fermionic infinite spin fields entering into the on-shell supersymmetric model are derived within the BRST method. Lagrangian for this supersymmetric model is written in terms of the complex infinite spin bosonic field and infinite spin fermionic Weyl field subject to supersymmetry transformations. The fields involved into the on-shell supersymmetric Lagrangian can be considered as components of six infinite spin chiral and antichiral multiplets. These multiplets are extended to the corresponding infinite spin chiral and antichiral superfields so that two chiral and antichiral superfields contain among the components the basic fields of an infinite spin supermultiplet and extra four chiral and antichiral superfields containing only the auxiliary fields needed for the Lagrangian formulation. The superfield Lagrangian is constructed in terms of these six chiral and antichiral supefields, and we show that the component form of this superfield Lagrangian exactly coincides with the previously found component supersymmetric Lagrangian after eliminating the component fields added to construct (anti)chiral superfields. \\ ( https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.12904 ,  13kb)

The SAGEX Review on Scattering Amplitudes, Chapter 2: An Invitation to  Color-Kinematics Duality and the Double Copy

  Advances in scattering amplitudes have exposed previously-hidden color-kinematics and double-copy structures in theories ranging from gauge and gravity theories to effective field theories such as chiral perturbation theory and the Born-Infeld model. These novel structures both simplify higher-order calculations and pose tantalizing questions related to a unified framework underlying relativistic quantum theories. This introductory mini-review article invites further exploration of these topics. After a brief introduction to color-kinematics duality and the double copy as they emerges at tree and loop-level in gauge and gravity theories, we present two distinct examples: 1) an introduction to the web of double-copy-constructible theories, and 2) a discussion on the application of the double copy to calculation relevant to gravitational-wave physics. \\ ( https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.13013 ,  584kb)

The SAGEX Review on Scattering Amplitudes, Chapter 3: Mathematical  structures in Feynman integrals
Samuel Abreu, Ruth Britto, Claude Duhr
  Dimensionally-regulated Feynman integrals are a cornerstone of all perturbative computations in quantum field theory. They are known to exhibit a rich mathematical structure, which has led to the development of powerful new techniques for their computation. We review some of the most recent advances in our understanding of the analytic structure of multiloop Feynman integrals in dimensional regularisation. In particular, we give an overview of modern approaches to computing Feynman integrals using differential equations, and we discuss some of the properties of the functions that appear in the solutions. We then review how dimensional regularisation has a natural mathematical interpretation in terms of the theory of twisted cohomology groups, and how many of the well-known ideas about Feynman integrals arise naturally in this context. \\ ( https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.13014 ,  77kb)

The SAGEX Review on Scattering Amplitudes, Chapter 5: Analytic  Bootstraps for Scattering Amplitudes and Beyond
Georgios Papathanasiou
  One of the main challenges in obtaining predictions for collider experiments from perturbative quantum field theory, is the direct evaluation of the Feynman integrals it gives rise to. In this chapter, we review an alternative bootstrap method that instead efficiently constructs physical quantities by exploiting their analytic structure. We present in detail the setting where this method has been originally developed, six- and seven-particle amplitudes in the large-color limit of $\mathcal{N}=4$ super Yang-Mills theory. We discuss the class of functions these amplitudes belong to, and the strong clues mathematical objects known as cluster algebras provide for rendering this function space both finite and of relatively small dimension at each loop order. We then describe how to construct this function space, as well as how to locate the amplitude inside of it with the help of kinematic limits, and apply the general procedure to a concrete example: The determination of the two-loop correction to the first nontrivial six-particle amplitude. We also provide an overview of other areas where the realm of the bootstrap paradigm is expanding, including other scattering amplitudes, form factors and Feynman integrals, and point out the analytic properties of potentially wider applicability that it has revealed. \\ ( https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.13016 ,  1503kb)

The SAGEX Review on Scattering Amplitudes, Chapter 6: Ambitwistor  Strings and Amplitudes from the Worldsheet
Yvonne Geyer, Lionel Mason
  Starting with Witten's twistor string, chiral string theories have emerged that describe field theory amplitudes without the towers of massive states of conventional strings. These models are known as ambitwistor strings due to their target space; the space of complexified null geodesics, also called ambitwistor space. Correlators in these string theories directly yield compact formulae for tree-level amplitudes and loop integrands, in the form of worldsheet integrals fully localized on solutions to constraints known as the scattering equations. In this chapter, we discuss two incarnations of the ambitwistor string: a 'vector representation' starting in space-time and structurally resembling the RNS superstring, and a four-dimensional twistorial version closely related to, but distinct from Witten's original model. The RNS-like models exist for several theories, with 'heterotic' and type II models describing super-Yang-Mills and 10d supergravities respectively, and they manifest the double copy relations directly at the level of the worldsheet models. In the second half of the chapter, we explain how the underlying models lead to diverse applications, ranging from extensions to new sectors of theories, loop amplitudes and to scattering on curved backgrounds. We conclude with a brief discussion of connections to conventional strings and celestial holography. \\ ( https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.13017 ,  2824kb)

The SAGEX Review on Scattering Amplitudes, Chapter 7: Positive Geometry  of Scattering Amplitudes
Enrico Herrmann, Jaroslav Trnka
  Scattering amplitudes are both a wonderful playground to discover novel ideas in Quantum Field Theory and simultaneously of immense phenomenological importance to make precision predictions for e.g.~particle collider observables and more recently also for gravitational wave signals. In this review chapter, we give an overview of some of the exciting recent progress on reformulating QFT in terms of mathematical, geometric quantities, such as polytopes, associahedra, Grassmanians, and the amplituhedron. In this novel approach, standard notions of locality and unitarity are derived concepts rather than fundamental ingredients in the construction which might give us a handle on a number of open questions in QFT that have evaded an answer for decades. We first give a basic summary of positive geometry, before discussing the associahedron -- one of the simplest physically relevant geometric examples -- and its relation to tree-level scattering amplitudes in bi-adjoint $\phi^3$ theory. Our second example is the amplituhedron construction for scattering amplitudes in planar maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory. \\ ( https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.13018 ,  1268kb)

The SAGEX Review on Scattering Amplitudes, Chapter 8: Half BPS  correlators
Paul Heslop
  Half BPS correlators in N=4 super Yang-Mills theory are key quantities both in the AdS/CFT correspondence as well as in scattering amplitudes research. They are dual at strong coupling to quantum gravity amplitudes. At weak coupling on the other hand they contain all N=4 SYM amplitudes. They have been found to possess a number of hidden symmetries, for example non-trivial permutation symmetry of perturbative four-point integrands and a higher dimensional conformal symmetry. Their study has enjoyed continuous progress since the discovery of AdS/CFT and they are now some of the best understood quantities of any four-dimensional quantum field theory.   In this review we outline the current knowledge of half BPS correlators, emphasising these two co-existing relations to scattering amplitudes at strong and weak coupling. \\ ( https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.13019 ,  180kb)

The SAGEX Review on Scattering Amplitudes, Chapter 9: Integrability of  Amplitudes in Fishnet Theories
Dmitry Chicherin, Gregory P. Korchemsky
  We discuss the properties of scattering amplitudes in a conformal bi-scalar fishnet theory that previously appeared in the study of integrable deformations of $\mathcal N=4$ SYM. In distinction with the latter theory, the scattering amplitudes in the conformal fishnet theory do not suffer from infrared divergences and possess enhanced symmetries. We demonstrate that for the simplest four-particle scattering the single- and double-trace partial amplitudes can be computed for arbitrary coupling in the leading color approximation. We also review the invariance of single-trace components of multi-particle fishnet amplitudes in the leading color limit under infinite-dimensional Yangian symmetry. \\ ( https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.13020 ,  515kb)

The SAGEX Review on Scattering Amplitudes, Chapter 10: Modular  covariance of type IIB string amplitudes and their $\mathcal{N}=4$  supersymmetric Yang-Mills duals
Daniele Dorigoni, Michael B. Green, Congkao Wen
  This article reviews recent developments in the understanding of the interplay of supersymmetry and modular covariance of scattering amplitudes in type IIB superstring theory and its holographic image in $\mathcal{N}=4$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory (SYM). The first section includes the determination of exact expressions for all BPS interactions in the low-energy expansion of superstring amplitudes. The second section concerns properties of a certain class of integrated correlators in $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM with arbitrary classical gauge group that are exactly determined by supersymmetric localisation. Not only do these reproduce known features of perturbative and non-perturbative $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM for any classical gauge group, but they have large-$N$ expansions that are in accord with expectations based on the holographic correspondence with superstring theory. The final section focusses on modular graph functions. These are modular functions that are closely associated with coefficients in the low-energy expansion of superstring perturbation theory and have recently received quite a lot of interest in both the physics and mathematics literature. \\ ( https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.13021 ,  150kb)

The SAGEX Review on Scattering Amplitudes, Chapter 11: Soft Theorems and  Celestial Amplitudes
Tristan McLoughlin, Andrea Puhm and Ana-Maria Raclariu
  The soft limits of scattering amplitudes have been extensively studied due to their essential role in the computation of physical observables in collider physics. The universal factorisation that occurs in these kinematic limits has been shown to be related to conservation laws associated with asymptotic, or large, gauge symmetries. This connection has led to a deeper understanding of the symmetries of gauge and gravitational theories and to a reformulation of scattering amplitudes in a basis of boost eigenstates which makes manifest the two-dimensional global conformal symmetry of the celestial sphere. The recast, or celestial, amplitudes possess many of the properties of conformal field theory correlation functions which has suggested a path towards a holographic description of asymptotically flat spacetimes. In this review we consider these interconnected developments in our understanding of soft theorems, asymptotic symmetries and conformal field theory with a focus on the structure and symmetries of the celestial amplitudes and their holographic interpretation. \\ ( https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.13022 ,  1386kb)

  We explore how various topics in modern scattering amplitudes research find application in the description of collider physics processes. After a brief review of experimentally measured quantities and how they are related to amplitudes, we summarise recent developments in perturbative QFT, and how they have impacted our ability to do precision physics with colliders. Next, we explain how the study of (next-to-)soft radiation is directly relevant to increasing theoretical precision for key processes at the LHC and related experiments. Finally, we describe the various techniques that are used to turn theoretical calculations into something more closely approaching the output of a particle accelerator. \\ ( https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.13023 ,  1969kb)

The SAGEX Review on Scattering Amplitudes, Chapter 13: Post-Minkowskian  expansion from Scattering Amplitudes
N.E.J. Bjerrum-Bohr, P.H. Damgaard, L. Plante, P. Vanhove
  The post-Minkowskian expansion of Einstein's general theory of relativity has received much attention in recent years due to the possibility of harnessing the computational power of modern amplitude calculations in such a classical context. In this brief review, we focus on the post-Minkowskian expansion as applied to the two-body problem in general relativity without spin, and we describe how relativistic quantum field theory can be used to greatly simplify analytical calculations based on the Einstein-Hilbert action. Subtleties related to the extraction of classical physics from such quantum mechanical calculations highlight the care which must be taken when both positive and negative powers of Planck's constant are at play. In the process of obtaining classical results in both Einstein gravity and supergravity, one learns new aspects of quantum field theory that are obscured when using units in which Planck's constant is set to unity. The scattering amplitude approach provides a self-contained framework for deriving the two-body scattering valid in all regimes of energy. There is hope that the full impact of amplitude computations in this field may significantly alter the way in which gravitational wave predictions will advance in the coming years. \\ ( https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.13024 ,  98kb)

The SAGEX Review on Scattering Amplitudes, Chapter 14: Classical Gravity  from Scattering Amplitudes
David A. Kosower, Ricardo Monteiro, Donal O'Connell
  Scattering amplitudes have their origin in quantum field theory, but have wide-ranging applications extending to classical physics. We review a formalism to connect certain classical observables to scattering amplitudes. An advantage of this formalism is that it enables us to study implications of the double copy in classical gravity. We discuss examples of observables including the total change of a particle's momentum, and the gravitational waveform, during a scattering encounter. The double copy also allows direct access to classical solutions in gravity. We review this classical double copy starting from its linearised level, where it originates in the double copy of three-point amplitudes. The classical double copy extends elegantly to exact solutions, making a connection between scattering amplitudes and the geometric formulation of General Relativity. \\ ( https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.13025 ,  73kb)

  We review the Regge and multi-Regge limit of scattering amplitudes in gauge theory, focusing on QCD and its maximally supersymmetric cousin, planar ${\cal N}=4$ super-Yang-Mills theory. We identify the large logarithms that are developed in these limits, and the progress that has been made in resumming them, towards next-to-next-to-leading logarithms for BFKL evolution in QCD, as well as all-orders proposals in planar ${\cal N}=4$ super-Yang-Mills theory and the perturbative checks of those proposals. We also cover the application of single-valued multiple polylogarithms to this important kinematical limit of particle scattering. \\ ( https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.13026 ,  307kb)

Light-Cone Quantization a of Scalar Field on Time-Dependent Backgrounds
Andrea Arduino and Igor Pesando
  We discuss what is light-cone quantization on a curved spacetime also without a null Killing vector. Then we consider as an example the light-cone quantization of a scalar field on a background with a Killing vector and the connection with the second quantization of the particle in the same background. It turns out that the proper way to define the light-cone quantization is to require that the constant light-cone time hypersurface is null or, equivalently, that the particle Hamiltonian is free of square roots. Moreover, in order to quantize the scalar theory it is necessary to use not the original scalar rather a scalar field density, i.e. the Schr\"odinger wave functional depends on a scalar density and not on the original field. Finally we recover this result as the second quantization of a particle on the same background, where it is necessary to add as input the fact that we are dealing with a scalar density. \\ ( https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.13062 ,  25kb)

Replica Symmetry Breaking in Random Non-Hermitian Systems
Antonio M. Garc\'ia-Garc\'ia, Yiyang Jia, Dario Rosa, Jacobus J. M.  Verbaarschot
  Recent studies have revealed intriguing similarities between the contribution of wormholes to the gravitational path integral and the phenomenon of replica symmetry breaking observed in spin glasses and other disordered systems. Interestingly, these configurations may also be important for the explanation of the information paradox of quantum black holes. Motivated by these developments, we investigate the thermodynamic properties of a $PT$-symmetric system composed of two random non-Hermitian Hamiltonians with no explicit coupling between them. After performing ensemble averaging, we identify numerically and analytically a robust first-order phase transition in the free energy of two models with quantum chaotic dynamics: the elliptic Ginibre ensemble of random matrices and a non-Hermitian Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model. The free energy of the Ginibre model is temperature-independent in the low-temperature phase. The SYK model has a similar behavior for sufficiently low temperature, then it experiences a possible continuous phase transition to a phase with a temperature-dependent free energy before the first-order transition takes place at a higher temperature. We identify the order parameter of the first-order phase transition and obtain analytical expressions for the critical temperature. The mechanism behind the transition is the existence of replica symmetry breaking configurations coupling Left and Right replicas that control the low-temperature limit of the partition function. We speculate that quantum chaos may be necessary for the observed dominance of off-diagonal replica symmetry breaking configurations in the low-temperature limit. \\ ( https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.13080 ,  3423kb)

Four-fermion deformations of the massless Schwinger model and  confinement
Aleksey Cherman, Theodore Jacobson, Mikhail Shifman, Mithat Unsal,  Arkady Vainshtein
  We consider the massless charge-$N$ Schwinger model and its deformation with two four-fermion operators. Without the deformations, this model exhibits chiral symmetry breaking without confinement. It is usually asserted that the massless Schwinger model is always deconfined and a string tension emerges only when a mass for the fermion field is turned on. We show that in the presence of these four-fermion operators, the massless theory can in fact confine. One of the four-fermion deformations is chirally neutral, and is a marginal deformation. The other operator can be relevant or irrelevant, and respects a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ subgroup of chiral symmetry for even $N$, hence forbidding a mass term. When it is relevant, even the exactly massless theory exhibits both confinement and spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking. The construction is analogous to QCD(adj) in 2d. While the theory without four-fermion deformations is deconfined, the theory with these deformations is generically in a confining phase. We study the model on $\mathbb{R}^2$ using bosonization, and also analyze the mechanism of confinement on $\mathbb{R}\times S^1$, where we find that confinement is driven by fractional instantons. \\ ( https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.13156 ,  2951kb)

  It is widely accepted that the next lepton collider beyond a Higgs factory would require center-of-mass energy of the order of up to 15 TeV. Since, given reasonable space and cost restrictions, conventional accelerator technology reaches its limits near this energy, high-gradient advanced acceleration concepts are attractive. Advanced and novel accelerators (ANAs) are leading candidates due to their ability to produce acceleration gradients on the order of 1--100~GV/m, leading to compact acceleration structures. Over the last 10-15 years significant progress has been achieved in accelerating electron beams by ANAs. For example, the demonstration of several-GeV electron beams from laser-powered capillary discharge waveguides, as well as the proof-of-principle coupling of two accelerating structures powered by different laser pulses, has increased interest in ANAs as a viable technology to be considered for a compact, TeV-class, lepton linear collider.   However, intermediate facilities are required to test the technology and demonstrate key subsystems. A 20-100 GeV center-of-mass energy ANA-based lepton collider can be a possible candidate for an intermediate facility. Apart from being a test beam facility for accelerator and detector studies, this collider will provide opportunities to study muon and proton beam acceleration, investigate charged particle interactions with extreme electromagnetic fields (relevant for beam delivery system designs and to study the physics at the interaction point), as well as precision Quantum Chromodynamics and Beyond the Standard Model physics measurements. Possible applications of this collider include the studies of $\gamma\gamma$ and $e$-ion collider designs. \\ ( https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.08425 ,  944kb)

The cosmic optical background excess, dark matter, and line-intensity  mapping
Jos\'e Luis Bernal, Gabriela Sato-Polito, Marc Kamionkowski
  Recent studies using New Horizons LORRI images have returned the most precise measurement of the cosmic optical background to date, yielding a flux that exceeds that expected from deep galaxy counts by roughly a factor of two. We investigate whether this excess, detected at $\sim 4\sigma$ significance, is due to dark matter that decays to a monoenergetic photon with a rest-frame energy in the range $0.5-10$ eV. We derive the spectral energy distribution from such decays and the contribution to the flux measured by LORRI. The parameter space that explains the measured excess with decays to photons with energies $E\gtrsim 4$ eV is unconstrained to date. If the excess arises from dark-matter decay to a photon line, there will be a significant signal in forthcoming line-intensity mapping measurements. Moreover, the ultraviolet instrument aboard New Horizons (which will have better sensitivity and probe a different range of the spectrum) and future studies of very high-energy $\gamma$-ray attenuation will also test this hypothesis and expand the search for dark matter to a wider range of frequencies. \\ ( https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.11236 ,  95kb)

Impact of event activity variable on the ratio of observables in isobar  collisions
Jiangyong Jia, Gang Wang and Chunjian Zhang
  The STAR isobar data of $^{96}$Ru+$^{96}$Ru and $^{96}$Zr+$^{96}$Zr collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}}= 200$ GeV show that ratios of observables ($R_{\mathcal{O}}$) such as the multiplicity distribution, $p(N_{\mathrm{ch}})$, and the harmonic flow, $v_n$, deviate from unity, when presented as a function of centrality, $c$. These deviations have been attributed to the differences in the shape and radial profiles between $^{96}$Ru and $^{96}$Zr nuclei. In addition, the ratios $R_{\mathcal{O}}(x)$ depend on the choice of the event activity variable $x$, which could be either $N_{\mathrm{ch}}$ or centrality. We estimate the difference $\Delta R$ between these two choices, based on the published $p(N_{\mathrm{ch}})$, as well as those from a multiphase transport (AMPT) model with varied nuclear structure parameters: nuclear radius ($R_0$), surface diffuseness ($a_0$), quadrupole deformation ($\beta_2$), and octupole deformation ($\beta_3$). In contrary to $R_{v_n}(c)$, $R_{v_n}(N_{\mathrm{ch}})$ is nearly independent of the analysis approaches, suggesting that nonflow effects are better controlled by $N_{\mathrm{ch}}$ than $c$. The ratios of observables sensitive to the chiral magnetic effect (CME) are also much closer to unity for $x=N_{\mathrm{ch}}$ than $x=c$, indicating that the ratios calculated at the same $N_{\mathrm{ch}}$ provide a better baseline for the non-CME background. According to the AMPT results, the dominant parameter for $\Delta R$ is $a_0$, while $R_0$ and $\beta_n$ are only important in central collisions. The published $p(N_{\mathrm{ch}})$ is also used to estimate $\Delta R_{\left\langle p_{\mathrm{T}}\right\rangle}$ for mean transverse momentum, which is non-negligible compared with $R_{\left\langle p_{\mathrm{T}}\right\rangle}-1$. \\ ( https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.12654 ,  214kb)

  Many physical systems can be best understood as sets of discrete data with associated relationships. Where previously these sets of data have been formulated as series or image data to match the available machine learning architectures, with the advent of graph neural networks (GNNs), these systems can be learned natively as graphs. This allows a wide variety of high- and low-level physical features to be attached to measurements and, by the same token, a wide variety of HEP tasks to be accomplished by the same GNN architectures. GNNs have found powerful use-cases in reconstruction, tagging, generation and end-to-end analysis. With the wide-spread adoption of GNNs in industry, the HEP community is well-placed to benefit from rapid improvements in GNN latency and memory usage. However, industry use-cases are not perfectly aligned with HEP and much work needs to be done to best match unique GNN capabilities to unique HEP obstacles. We present here a range of these capabilities, predictions of which are currently being well-adopted in HEP communities, and which are still immature. We hope to capture the landscape of graph techniques in machine learning as well as point out the most significant gaps that are inhibiting potentially large leaps in research. \\ ( https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.12852 ,  787kb)

No evidence for EDE from Planck data in extended scenarios
Emanuele Fondi, Alessandro Melchiorri, Luca Pagano
  The latest data release from the ACT CMB experiment (in combination with previous WMAP data) shows evidence for an Early Dark Energy component at more than $3$ standard deviations. The same conclusion has been recently shown to hold when temperature data from the Planck experiment limited to intermediate angular scales ($l \le 650$) are included while it vanishes when the full Planck dataset is considered. However, it has been shown that the full Planck dataset exhibits an anomalous lensing component and a preference for a closed universe at the level of three standard deviation. It is therefore of utmost importance to investigate if these anomalies could anti-correlate with an early dark energy component and hide its presence during the process of parameter extraction. Here we demonstrate that extended parameters choices as curvature, equation of state of dark energy and lensing amplitude $A_L$ have no impact on the Planck constraints on EDE. In practice, EDE does not solve Planck angular spectra anomalies. This indicates that current CMB evidence for an EDE component comes essentially from the ACT-DR4 dataset. \\ ( https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.12930 ,  1338kb)

Deuteron VVCS and nuclear structure effects in muonic deuterium at N3LO  in pionless EFT
Vadim Lensky, Franziska Hagelstein, Astrid Hiller Blin, Vladimir  Pascalutsa
  We present our studies of the forward unpolarised doubly-virtual Compton scattering (VVCS) off the deuteron and the closely related two-photon-exchange ($2\gamma$-exchange) corrections to the Lamb shift of muonic deuterium. The deuteron VVCS amplitude is calculated in the framework of pionless effective field theory, up to next-to-next-to-next-to-leading order (N3LO) for the longitudinal and next-to-leading order (NLO) for the transverse amplitude. The charge elastic form factor of the deuteron, obtained from the residue of the longitudinal VVCS amplitude, is used to extract the value of the single unknown two-nucleon one-photon contact coupling that enters the longitudinal amplitude at N3LO. The obtained deuteron VVCS amplitude serves as a high-precision model-independent input to examine the $2\gamma$-exchange corrections. Substantial differences with the recent dispersive evaluations are identified, namely, the elastic contribution appears to be larger by several standard deviations, thus ameliorating the current discrepancy between theory and experiment on the size of $2\gamma$-exchange effects. A correlation between the values of the deuteron charge and Friar radii is found that can be used to judge on the quality of a parametrisation of the deuteron charge elastic form factor. The discrepancy between the theory and the empirical result for the $2\gamma$-exchange correction in muonic deuterium appears to be completely eliminated. To further confirm this, we revisit the hydrogen-deuterium isotope shift in the same framework. Our work provides an alternative self-consistent and high-precision evaluation of the $2\gamma$-exchange correction in (muonic) deuterium. \\ ( https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.13030 ,  448kb)

New determination of the production cross section for secondary  positrons and electrons in the Galaxy
Luca Orusa, Mattia Di Mauro, Fiorenza Donato, Michael Korsmeier
  The cosmic-ray fluxes of electrons and positrons ($e^{\pm}$) are measured with high precision by the space-borne particle spectrometer AMS-02. To infer a precise interpretation of the production processes for $e^{\pm}$ in our Galaxy, it is necessary to have an accurate description of the secondary component, produced by the interaction of cosmic-ray proton and helium with the interstellar medium atoms. We determine new analytical functions of the Lorentz invariant cross section for the production of $\pi^\pm$ and $K^\pm$ by fitting data from collider experiments. We also evaluate the invariant cross sections for several other channels, involving for example hyperon decays, contributing at the few \% level on the total cross section. For all these particles, the relevant 2 and 3 body decay channels are implemented, with the polarized $\mu^\pm$ decay computed with next-to-leading order corrections. The cross section for scattering of nuclei heavier than protons is modeled by fitting data on $p+C$ collisions. The total differential cross section $d\sigma/dT_{e^\pm}(p+p\rightarrow e^\pm+X)$ is predicted from 10 MeV up to 10 TeV of $e^\pm$ energy with an uncertainty of about 5-7\% in the energies relevant for AMS-02 positron flux, thus dramatically reducing the precision of the theoretical model with respect to the state of the art. Finally, we provide a prediction for the secondary Galactic $e^\pm$ source spectrum with an uncertainty of the same level. As a service for the scientific community, we provide numerical tables and a script to calculate energy-differential cross sections. \\ ( https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.13143 ,  900kb)

Direct Photons in Hydrodynamic Modeling of Relativistic Nuclear  Collisions
Akihiko Monnai
  We review direct photons in the phenomenology of nuclear collisions at relativistic energies. Direct photons carry information about the space-time evolution of nuclear collisions because the QCD medium is transparent against colorless particles. After a status summary of theoretical and experimental studies, transverse momentum spectra and azimuthal momentum anisotropies of direct photons are studied in the context of the hydrodynamic modeling of relativistic nuclear collisions with emphasis on pre-equilibrium photons. It is implied that pre-equilibrium photons can be as important as thermal and prompt photons for comprehensive understanding of direct photon production. \\ ( https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.13208 ,  355kb)

Fermi Bubbles in Scalar Field Dark Matter halos
Tonatiuh Matos, Abdel Perez-Lorenzana, Jordi Sol\'is-L\'opez
  In recent times, the Scalar Field Dark Matter (SFDM) model (also called Fuzzy, Wave, Ultralight dark matter model) has received much attention due to its success in describing dark matter on both cosmological and galactic scales. Several challenges of the Cold Dark Matter (CDM) model can be explained very easily and naturally by the SFDM model. Two of these challenges are to describe the anomalous trajectories of satellite galaxies called the Vast Polar Structure (VPOS) and to explain the Fermi Bubbles (FB) observed in our galaxy. In Phys.Rev.D103(2021)083535 an alternative explanation for VPOS was shown using the SFDM excited states, explaining the anomalous trajectories in a natural and simple way. In this work we use the same dark matter structure to show that these excited states of the SFDM can provide a very simple and natural explanation for the FB, assuming that the SFDM is a kind of dark boson. If this assumption is correct, we should see FB in several more galaxies and continue to see gamma-ray events at higher energies, these observations would take place in the near future and could be crucial to the ultimate answer to the nature of dark matter. \\ ( https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.13218 ,  217kb)

First law of black hole thermodynamics and Smarr formula with a  cosmological constant
Kamal Hajian, Hikmet \"Oz\c{s}ahin, Bayram Tekin
  The first law of black hole thermodynamics in the presence of a cosmological constant $\Lambda$ can be generalized by introducing a term containing the variation $\delta\Lambda$. Similar to other terms in the first law, which are variations of some conserved charges like mass, entropy, angular momentum, electric charge etc., it has been shown [Classical Quantum Gravity 35, 125012 (2018)] that the new term has the same structure: $\Lambda$ is a conserved charge associated with a gauge symmetry; and its role in the first law is quite similar to an ``electric charge" rather than to the pressure. Besides, its conjugate chemical potential resembles an ``electric potential" on the horizon, in contrast with the volume enclosed by horizon. In this work, first we propose and prove the generalized Smarr relation in this new paradigm. Then, we reproduce systematically the ``effective volume" of a black hole which has been introduced before in the literature as the conjugate of pressure. Our construction removes the ambiguity in the definition of volume. Finally, we apply and investigate this formulation of ``$\Lambda$ as a charge" on a number of solutions to different models of gravity for different spacetime dimensions. Especially, we investigate the applicability and validity of the analysis for black branes, whose enclosed volume is not well defined in principle. \\ ( https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.10983 ,  32kb)

Topological Superfluid Defects with Discrete Point Group Symmetries
Y. Xiao, M. O. Borgh, A. A. Blinova, T. Ollikainen, J. Ruostekoski,  and D. S. Hall
  Discrete symmetries are spatially ubiquitous but are often hidden in internal states of systems where they can have especially profound consequences. In this work we create and verify exotic magnetic phases of atomic spinor Bose-Einstein condensates that, despite their continuous character and intrinsic spatial isotropy, exhibit complex discrete polytope symmetries in their topological defects. Using carefully tailored spinor rotations and microwave transitions, we engineer singular line defects whose quantization conditions, exchange statistics, and dynamics are fundamentally determined by these underlying symmetries. We show how filling the vortex line singularities with atoms in a variety of different phases leads to core structures that possess magnetic interfaces with rich combinations of discrete and continuous symmetries. Such defects, with their non-commutative properties, could provide unconventional realizations of quantum information and interferometry. \\ ( https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.08186 ,  15455kb)

Charged Accelerating BTZ black holes
B. Eslam Panah
  In this paper, we first extract general uncharged accelerating BTZ black hole solutions and study some of their properties. Our analysis shows that spacetime's asymptotical behavior depends on four parameters (the cosmological constant, mass, the acceleration parameter, and the topological constant). Then, we study the temperature of these black holes and find a divergence point, which this point reveals a phase transition between physical and non-physical black holes. Next, we extend our study for extracting charged accelerating BTZ black hole solutions in the presence of a nonlinear electrodynamics field, known as conformally invariant Maxwell. Our findings indicate that there is a coupling between the electrical charge and other quantities of the accelerating BTZ black holes. We find that the asymptotical behavior of charged accelerating BTZ black holes depends on six parameters (the cosmological constant, the electrical charge, mass, the acceleration parameter, topological constant, and angular coordinate). Finally, we investigate the effects of various parameters on the temperature of these black holes. There are two exciting behaviors for the temperature by considering different cosmological constant values. A divergence point exists for the temperature when the cosmological constant is negative. However, for the positive value of the cosmological constant, there are two critical points in the temperature; a root and a divergence point. These points give us information about phase transitions between physical and non-physical black holes. \\ ( https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.12619 ,  507kb)

Torsion and the Probability of Inflation
Emma Albertini, Stephon Alexander, Gabriel Herczeg, Joao Magueijo
  We revisit the problem of the "probability of inflation" from the point of view of the Einstein-Cartan theory, where torsion can be present off-shell even in the absence of spinorial currents. An informal estimate suggests that the barrier for tunneling from "nothing" into a classical universe becomes thinner and lower, should torsion be present even if only off-shell. This is confirmed by a detailed calculation, where the usual assumptions are re-evaluated and repurposed in our situation. Interestingly some approximations used in the literature (such as the WKB approximation) are not needed in general, and in particular in our case. When we consider wave packets centered around zero torsion, however, the conclusion depends crucially how these are built. With a Klein-Gordon current prescription for the measure and probability, for small torsion variance, {\sigma}_c, we recover the plane wave results. Nonetheless, for large {\sigma}c, higher order corrections could reverse this conclusion. \\ ( https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.12640 ,  767kb)

Spectral Form Factor of a Quantum Spin Glass
Michael Winer, Richard Barney, Christopher L. Baldwin, Victor  Galitski, Brian Swingle
  It is widely expected that systems which fully thermalize are chaotic in the sense of exhibiting random-matrix statistics of their energy level spacings, whereas integrable systems exhibit Poissonian statistics. In this paper, we investigate a third class: spin glasses. These systems are partially chaotic but do not achieve full thermalization due to large free energy barriers. We examine the level spacing statistics of a canonical infinite-range quantum spin glass, the quantum $p$-spherical model, using an analytic path integral approach. We find statistics consistent with a direct sum of independent random matrices, and show that the number of such matrices is equal to the number of distinct metastable configurations -- the exponential of the spin glass "complexity" as obtained from the quantum Thouless-Anderson-Palmer equations. We also consider the statistical properties of the complexity itself and identify a set of contributions to the path integral which suggest a Poissonian distribution for the number of metastable configurations. Our results show that level spacing statistics can probe the ergodicity-breaking in quantum spin glasses and provide a way to generalize the notion of spin glass complexity beyond models with a semi-classical limit. \\ ( https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.12753 ,  2561kb)

Effect of relativity and vacuum fluctuations on quantum measurement
Adam Bednorz, Wolfgang Belzig
  Vacuum fluctuations can obscure the detection signal of the measurement of the smallest quantum objects like single particles seemingly implying a fundamental limit to measurement accuracy. However, as we show relativistic invariance implies the disappearance of fluctuations for the space-like %frequency-wavevector spectrum of an observable at zero temperature. This complete absence of noise can be harnessed to perform noiseless measurement of single particles, as we illustrate for electrons or photons. We outline a general scheme to illustrate the noiseless measurement involving the space-like spectrum of observables based on the self-interference of counter-propagating paths of a single particle in a triangular Sagnac interferometer. \\ ( https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.13187 ,  234kb)
