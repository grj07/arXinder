When Does A Three-Dimensional Chern-Simons-Witten Theory Have A Time Reversal Symmetry?
Roman Geiko,Gregory W. Moore
In this paper, we completely characterize time-reversal invariant three-dimensional Chern-Simons gauge theories with torus gauge group. At the level of the Lagrangian, toral Chern-Simons theory is defined by an integral lattice, while at the quantum level, it is entirely determined by a quadratic function on a finite Abelian group and an integer mod 24. We find that quantum time-reversally symmetric theories can be defined by classical Lagrangians defined by integral lattices which have self-perpendicular embeddings into a unimodular lattice. We give an explicit list of finite Abelian groups equipped with quadratic functions such that all T-invariant quantum theories must be direct sums of the elements of that list. In the non-Abelian case, we conjecture that the Chern-Simons theory admits a time-reversal symmetry iff the associated modular tensor category is an order two element in the Witt group of non-degenerate braided fusion categories.

Encoded information of mixed correlations: the views from one dimension higher
Mahdis Ghodrati
After reviewing the JT gravity, we discuss the four saddles in the mixed correlation measures of black holes Hawking radiation in the setup of geometric evaporation of <a href="http://export.arxiv.org/abs/2102.00922">arXiv:2102.00922</a>. By looking from $1d$ higher point of view and partial dimensional reduction, we examine the phase structures and the universalities for these four saddles. We also discuss the behavior of quantum error correction codes for each of these four phases, reaching to consistent results. Then, instead of dimension reduction between Einstein gravity and JT, we try to explore the connections between partition functions and saddles of $3d$ Chern-Simons and $2d$ BF theories, $2d$ Liouville and $2d$ Wess-Zumino-Witten models, and also the dimensionally reduced $1d$ Schwarzian and $1d$ particles on group. We comment on the connections between these theories in the setup of mixed correlations and Page curves. We then examine further the information that can be gathered by looking from $1d$ higher, specifically through studying the negativity and Kaluza-Klein, charged, and extremal black holes. Finally, we explore several measurable observables in the setup of dimension reductions, such as quantum fluctuations, Kondo effect, Berry phase, quantum focussing and complexity. We comment on how Berry phase could determine the connectivity of spacetime and the types of replica wormholes, and also sketch the connections between brane tomography model, inception geometry and replica wormholes using the island formulation and mixed correlation measures.

On the absence of bound states for a planar massless Brown-Ravenhall-type operator
M.B. Alves,O.M. Del Cima,D.H.T. Franco
We address the question of the existence of bound states for a suitably projected two-dimensional massless Dirac operator in the presence of a Bessel-Macdonald potential (also known as $K_0$-potential potential), raised by De Lima, Del Cima and Miranda, in Eur.Phys.J. B (2020) 93, 187. Based on Relativistic Hardy Inequality, we prove that this operator has no bound states if $\gamma \leqslant \gamma_{\rm crit}$ (subcritical region), where $\gamma$ is a coupling constant.

Resource and stability near a critical point from the quantum information perspective
Mohammad Ali-Akbari,Mahsa Lezgi
In the presence of chemical potential and temperature, we holographically study subregion complexity in a non-conformal quantum field theory with a critical point. We propose a new interpretation according to which the states, needing (more) less information to be specified, characterize the (un) stable thermodynamical solutions. We observe the increasing and decreasing effects of chemical potential and temperature on holographic subregion complexity, respectively. These two opposite behaviors lead to a point where subregion complexity of the mixed state is the same as this value for a zero temperature conformal field theory. We also present a new description of the difference between the minimum and the maximum value (the value near the critical point) of holographic subregion complexity as a resource for doing computational work to prepare the state near the critical point from the state far from it. We also calculate the critical exponent.

Quantum Complexity and Holography
Javier Martin-Garcia
This thesis develops recent work on the so called Volume-Complexity and Action-Complexity conjectures. According to this family of proposals, geometric quantities can be defined in some holographic gravitational theories that can be mapped with the concept of quantum complexity for states in a dual quantum-mechanical theory. </p> <p>In this work, we review the original motivations for the use of quantum-information theory in the search of a theory of quantum gravity, and argue in favour of holographic complexity as a promising new tool that could play a key role in the elucidation of the properties of black holes. </p> <p>After this introduction, we devote some time to the study of `exotic' thermodynamical systems of diverse origin, confronting the conjectures with expectations and seeking for new behaviours of holographic complexity that could help us understand or refine the existing proposals. </p> <p>Next, we turn our attention to the study of holographic complexity for singular spacetimes, defining slightly modified versions of the conjecture that are well adapted to singularities and searching for universal behaviours of complexity dynamics within these setups. </p> <p>Finally, we finish with some speculations about the relation between holographic complexity and older characterization criteria for singularities in general relativity.

Deriving dilaton potential in improved holographic QCD from chiral condensate
Koji Hashimoto,Keisuke Ohashi,Takayuki Sumimoto
We derive an explicit form of the dilaton potential in improved holographic QCD (IHQCD) from the QCD lattice data of the chiral condensate as a function of the quark mass. This establishes a data-driven holographic modeling of QCD -- machine learning holographic QCD. The modeling consists of two steps for solving inverse problems. The first inverse problem is to find the emergent bulk geometry consistent with the lattice QCD simulation data at the boundary. We solve this problem with the refinement of neural ordinary differential equation, a machine learning technique. The second inverse problem is to derive a bulk gravity action with a dilaton potential such that its solution is the emergent bulk geometry. We solve this problem at non-zero temperature, and derive the explicit form of the dilaton potential. The dilaton potential determines the bulk action, the Einstein-dilaton system, thus we derive holographically the bulk system from the QCD chiral condensate data. The usefulness of the model is shown in the example of the prediction of the string breaking distance, whose value is found to be consistent with another lattice QCD data.

Dark Sector Physics at High-Intensity Experiments - (cross-listed hep-ph)
Stefania Gori,Mike Williams,Phil Ilten,Nhan Tran,Gordan Krnjaic,Natalia Toro,Brian Batell,Nikita Blinov,Christopher Hearty,Robert McGehee,Philip Harris,Philip Schuster,Jure Zupan
Is Dark Matter part of a Dark Sector? The possibility of a dark sector neutral under Standard Model (SM) forces furnishes an attractive explanation for the existence of Dark Matter (DM), and is a compelling new-physics direction to explore in its own right, with potential relevance to fundamental questions as varied as neutrino masses, the hierarchy problem, and the Universe's matter-antimatter asymmetry. Because dark sectors are generically weakly coupled to ordinary matter, and because they can naturally have MeV-to-GeV masses and respect the symmetries of the SM, they are only mildly constrained by high-energy collider data and precision atomic measurements. Yet upcoming and proposed intensity-frontier experiments will offer an unprecedented window into the physics of dark sectors, highlighted as a Priority Research Direction in the 2018 Dark Matter New Initiatives (DMNI) BRN report. Support for this program -- in the form of dark-sector analyses at multi-purpose experiments, realization of the intensity-frontier experiments receiving DMNI funds, an expansion of DMNI support to explore the full breadth of DM and visible final-state signatures (especially long-lived particles) called for in the BRN report, and support for a robust dark-sector theory effort -- will enable comprehensive exploration of low-mass thermal DM milestones, and greatly enhance the potential of intensity-frontier experiments to discover dark-sector particles decaying back to SM particles.

On the mass dependence of the modular operator for a double cone - (cross-listed math-ph)
Henning Bostelmann,Daniela Cadamuro,Christoph Minz
We present a numerical approximation scheme for the Tomita-Takesaki modular operator of local subalgebras in linear quantum fields, working at one-particle level. This is applied to the local subspaces for double cones in the vacuum sector of a massive scalar free field in (1 + 1)- and (3 + 1)-dimensional Minkowski spacetime, using a discretization of time-0 data in position space. In the case of a wedge region, one component of the modular generator is well-known to be a mass-independent multiplication operator; our results strongly suggest that for the double cone, the corresponding component is still at least close to a multiplication operator, but that it is dependent on mass and angular momentum.

Universal horizons and black hole spectroscopy in gravitational theories with broken Lorentz symmetry - (cross-listed gr-qc)
Chao Zhang,Anzhong Wang,Tao Zhu
The violation of Lorentz invariance (LI) in gravitational theories, which allows superluminal propagations, dramatically alters the causal structure of the spacetime and modifies the notion of black holes. In particular, instead of metric horizons, now {\it universal horizons} define the boundaries of black holes, within which a particle cannot escape to spatial infinities even with an infinitely large speed. Then, a natural question is how the quasi-normal modes (QNMs) of a black hole are modified, if one considers the universal horizon as its causal boundary. In this paper, we study in detail this problem in Einstein-aether theory, a vector-tensor theory that violates LI but yet is self-consistent and satisfies all observations carried out so far. Technically, this poses several challenges, including singularities of the perturbation equations across metric horizons and proper identifications of ingoing modes at universal horizons. After overcoming these difficulties, we show that the QNMs of the Schwarzschild black hole, also a solution of Einstein-aether theory, consist of two parts, the metric and aether parts. The QNMs of the metric perturbations are quite similar to those obtained in general relativity and are consistent with current observations of gravitational waves. But the ones from aether perturbations are different, and our numerical studies indicate that they are even not stable. The latter is consistent with our previous studies, which showed that the stealth Schwarzschild black hole suffers a Laplacian instability along the angular direction. The method and techniques developed in this paper can be applied to the studies of QNMs in other theories of gravity with broken LI.

Some Aspects of Quantum Mechanics and Quantum Field Theory on Quantum Space- Time
Partha Nandi
This thesis is devoted to studying various aspects of quantum mechanics on non-commutative space-time and to capture some of the surviving aspects of symmetries of quantum field theory on such space-time, illustrated through toy models in (0 + 1) dimension. This allows one to gain some insights into this and other related issues in a more transparent manner.

Thick branes in Born-Infeld determinantal gravity in Weitzenb\"ock spacetime
Ke Yang,Hao Yu,Yi Zhong
By adopting the idea of Born-Infeld electromagnetism, the Born-Infeld determinantal gravity in Weitzenb\"ock spacetime provides a way to smooth the Big Bang singularity at the classical level. We consider a thick braneworld scenario in the higher-dimensional extension of this gravity, and investigate the torsion effects on the brane structure and gravitational perturbation. For three particular parameter choices, analytic domain wall solutions are obtained. They have a similar brane configuration that the brane thickness becomes thinner as the spacetime torsion gets stronger. For each model, the massless graviton is localized on the brane with the width of localization decreasing with the enhancement of the spacetime torsion, while the massive gravitons propagate in the bulk and contribute a correction term proportional to ${1}/{(k r)^{3}}$ to the Newtonian potential. A sparsity constraint on the fundamental 5-dimensional gravitational scale is estimated from the gravitational experiment. Moreover, the parameter ranges in which the Kaluza-Klein gravitons are tachyonic free are analyzed.

The Cosmological Black Hole - (cross-listed gr-qc)
Zacharias Roupas
We briefly review the recent novel solution of General Relativity, we call the cosmological black hole, firstly discovered in [Roupas, Z. Eur. Phys. J. C 82, 255 (2022)]. A dark energy universe and a Schwartzschild black hole are matched on a common dual event horizon which is finitely thick due to quantum indeterminacy. The system gets stabilized by a finite tangential pressure applied on the dual horizon. The fluid entropy of the system at a Tolman temperature identified with the cosmological horizon temperature is calculated to be equal with the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy.

Holographic Non-local Rotating Observables and their Renormalization
Vangelis Giantsos,Dimitrios Giataganas
We analyse non-local rotating observables in holography corresponding to spinning bound states. To renormalize their energies and momenta we suggest and discuss different holographic renormalization schemes motivated by the static non-local observables. Namely the holographic renormalization and the rotating color singlet mass subtraction scheme. In the holographic renormalization we identify the infinite boundary terms and subtract them. In the mass subtraction scheme we evaluate the energy of a spinning trailing string corresponding to the color charged singlet which experiences dragging phenomena and we subtract it from the energy of the bound state to obtain the renormalized finite energy. Then we apply our generic framework to certain strongly coupled thermal theories with broken rotational symmetry. We find numerical solutions corresponding to spinning bound states with a fixed size while varying their angular frequency. By applying numerically the renormalization schemes, we find that there is a critical frequency where the bound state ceases to exist or dissociates. We also note that bound states require lower angular frequencies to dissociate when the theory has less symmetry.

Finiteness of Entanglement Entropy in Collective Field Theory
Sumit R. Das,Antal Jevicki,Junjie Zheng
We explore the question of finiteness of the entanglement entropy in gravitational theories whose emergent space is the target space of a holographic dual. In the well studied duality of two-dimensional non-critical string theory and $c=1$ matrix model, this question has been studied earlier using fermionic many-body theory in the space of eigenvalues. The entanglement entropy of a subregion of the eigenvalue space, which is the target space entanglement in the matrix model, is finite, with the scale being provided by the local Fermi momentum. The Fermi momentum is, however, a position-dependent string coupling, as is clear in the collective field theory formulation. This suggests that the finiteness is a non-perturbative effect. We provide evidence for this expectation by an explicit calculation in the collective field theory of matrix quantum mechanics with vanishing potential. The leading term in the cumulant expansion of the entanglement entropy is calculated using exact eigenstates and eigenvalues of the collective Hamiltonian, yielding a finite result, in precise agreement with the fermion answer. Treating the theory perturbatively, we show that each term in the perturbation expansion is UV divergent. However the series can be resummed, yielding the exact finite result. Our results indicate that the finiteness of the entanglement entropy for higher dimensional string theories is non-perturbative as well, with the scale provided by the Newton constant.

Truth, or Mere Beauty?
Djordje Radicevic
High energy physics features many ingenious tools for extracting finite results from formally divergent expressions. This brief note argues from a new perspective that all such formal infinities are meaningful markers of new physics. As such, they deserve to be explored in detail -- and even the simplest quantum field theories have more of them than is commonly thought.

The effective potential of the Polyakov loop in the Hamiltonian approach to QCD - (cross-listed hep-ph)
Markus Quandt,Hugo Reinhardt
We investigate the effective potential of the Polyakov loop, which is the order parameter for the deconfinement phase transition in finite temperature QCD. Our work is based on the Hamiltonian approach in Coulomb gauge where finite temperature $T$ is introduced by compactifying one space direction. We briefly review this approach and extend earlier work in the Yang-Mills sector by including dynamical quarks. In a first approximation, we follow the usual functional approach and include only one-loop contributions to the energy, with the finite temperature propagators replaced by their $T=0$ counter parts. It is found that this gives a poor description of the phase transition, in particular for the case of full QCD with $N_f = 3$ light flavours. The physical reasons for this unexpected result are discussed, and pinned down to a relative weakness of gluon confinement compared to the deconfining tendency of the quarks. We attempt to overcome this issue by including the relevant gluon contributions from the two-loop terms to the energy. We find that the two-loop corrections have indeed a tendency to strengthen the gluon confinement and weaken the unphysical effects in the confining phase, while slightly increasing the (pseudo-)critical temperature $T^\ast$ at the same time. To fully suppress artifacts in the confining phase, we must tune the parameters to rather large values, increasing the critical temperature to $T^\ast \approx 340\,\mathrm{MeV}$ for $G=SU(2)$.

A Worldsheet Description of Instant Folded Strings
Akikazu Hashimoto,Nissan Itzhaki,Uri Peleg
Time-like linear dilaton backgrounds admit a classical solution that describes a closed folded string that is created at an instant. We refer to such strings as Instant Folded Strings (IFS). We study an exact worldsheet CFT description of an IFS that involves two vertex operators which describe two open string modes that propagate on a time-like FZZT-brane, which plays the role of a regulator to the IFS. We take advantage of this description to calculate the most basic quantity associated with IFSs - their production rate. Some implications of this calculation to stringy cosmology and black hole interior are briefly discussed.

Octonionic Magical Supergravity, Niemeier Lattices, and Exceptional and Hilbert Modular Forms
Murat Gunaydin,Abhiram Kidambi
We show that the quantum degeneracies of spherically symmetric stationary BPS black holes of octonionic magical supergravity in five dimensions are given by the Fourier coefficients of the modular forms of the arithmetic subgroup of the exceptional group $E_{7(-25)}$ that had been proposed as a spectrum generating extension of its U-duality group $E_{6(-26)}$. Arithmetic group $E_{7(-25)}(\mathbb{Z})$ acts as the discrete conformal group of the exceptional Jordan algebra $J_3^{\mathbb{O}}(\mathcal{R})$ over the integral octonions of Coxeter $\mathcal{R}$. The charges of the black holes take values on the lattice defined by $J_3^{\mathbb{O}}(\mathcal{R})$. Degeneracies of rank one and rank two quantum BPS black holes are given by the Fourier coefficients of singular modular forms $E_4(Z)$ of weight 4 and $E_8(Z)=(E_4(Z))^2$ of weight 8 of $E_{7(-25)}(\mathbb{Z})$. The degeneracies of rank 3 BPS black holes are given by the Fourier coefficients of the powers $(E_4(Z))^n$ of $E_4(Z)$ for $n>2$. Using the results of Elkies and Gross on the embeddings of cubic rings $A$ into the exceptional Jordan algebra and their action on the 24 dimensional orthogonal quadratic subspace of $J_3^{\mathbb{O}}(\mathcal{R})$, we show that the degeneracies of rank one black holes described by such embeddings are given by the Fourier coefficients of the Hilbert modular forms of $SL(2,A)$ which is a discrete subgroup of $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})^3$. If the discriminant of the cubic ring is $D=p^2$ with $p$ a prime number then the isotropic lines in the 24 dimensional quadratic space define a pair of Niemeier lattices which can be taken as charge lattices of some BPS black holes. For $p=7$ they are the Leech lattice with no roots and the lattice $A_6^4$ with 168 root vectors. We also review the current status of the searches for the M/superstring theoretic origins of the octonionic magical supergravity.

On Symplectic Form for Null Boundary Phase Space - (cross-listed gr-qc)
M.M. Sheikh-Jabbari
To formulate gravity in spacetimes bounded by a null boundary, an arbitrary hypothetical null surface, boundary degrees of freedom (d.o.f) should be added to account for the d.o.f and dynamics in the spacetime regions excised behind the null boundary. In the D dimensional example, boundary d.o.f are labelled by D charges defined at D-2 dimensional spacelike slices at the null boundary. While boundary modes can have their own boundary dynamics, their interaction with the bulk modes is governed by flux-balance equations which may be interpreted as a diffusion equation describing "dissolution" of bulk gravitons into the boundary. From boundary viewpoint, boundary d.o.f obey local thermodynamical equations at the boundary. Our description suggests a new "semiclassical" quantization of the system in which boundary d.o.f are quantized while bulk is classical. This semiclassical treatment may be relevant to questions in black hole physics.

Unitarity and Dilaton effective theory - (cross-listed hep-ph)
Deog Ki Hong,Gyurin Kim,Jun Beom Park
From the low-energy effective theory of dilatons, consistent with the scale anomaly, we calculate the $2\to2$ scattering amplitudes of dilatons. We find that the one-loop amplitude violates the unitarity bound as the scattering energy approaches the cutoff of the effective theory, $\sqrt{s}=\sqrt{4\pi} f_D$. We then show that the inclusion of the next-to-lightest state, namely the spin-2 state, of mass around the cutoff improves the unitarity. The unitarity argument suggests that the mass ratio of the dilaton and the spin-2 state is proportional to the square of the Miransky-BKT scaling of the near conformal dynamics.

Geometry of Spin(10) Symmetry Breaking
Kirill Krasnov
We provide a new characterisation of the Standard Model gauge group GSM as a subgroup of Spin(10). The new description of GSM relies on the geometry of pure spinors. We show that GSM inside Spin(10) is the group that stabilises a pure spinor psi_1 and projectively stabilises another pure spinor psi_2, with psi_{1,2} such that psi_2 is distinct from psi_1 and their arbitrary linear combination is still a pure spinor. Our characterisation of GSM relies on the facts that projective pure spinors describe complex structures on R^{10}, and the product of two commuting complex structures is a what is known as a product structure. For the pure spinors psi_{1,2} satisfying the stated conditions the arising product structure is R^{10}=R^6+R^4, giving rise to a copy of Pati-Salam gauge group inside Spin(10). Our main statement then follows from the fact that GSM is the intersection of the Georgi-Glashow SU(5) that stabilises psi_1, and the Pati-Salam Spin(6)x Spin(4) arising from the product structure determined by psi_{1,2}. We have tried to make the paper self-contained and provided a detailed description of the creation/annihilation operator construction of the Clifford algebras Cl(2n) and the geometry of pure spinors in dimensions up to and including ten.

Categorical generalization of MacDowell Mansouri gravity coupled to Kalb Ramond fields - (cross-listed gr-qc)
Miguel A. Oliveira
In this work we generalize the MacDowell-Mansouri theory of gravity using strict 2-groups. To achieve this, we construct the categorical generalization of the ISO(4,1) group, which we call the de Sitter 2-group. We then proceed to generalize the MacDowell-Mansouri theory in two different ways. First, as a Yang-Mills-type theory, where the symmetry is explicitly broken to obtain an Einstein-Cartan theory coupled to Kalb-Ramond fields. And second, by using the categorical generalization of the BF theory, called 2-BF theory, which after the addition of some symmetry breaking and constraint terms gives the same Einstein-Cartan theory coupled to Kalb-Ramond fields plus some extra topological terms.

Chaotic string motion in a near pp-wave limit
Shodai Kushiro,Kentaroh Yoshida
We revisit classical string motion in a near pp-wave limit of AdS$_5\times$S$^5$. It is known that the Toda lattice models are integrable. But if the exponential potential is truncated at finite order, then the system may become non-integrable. In particular, when the exponential potential in a three-particle periodic Toda chain is truncated at the third order of the dynamical variables, the resulting system becomes a well-known non-integrable system, Henon-Heiles model. The same thing may happen in a near pp-wave limit of AdS$_5\times$S$^5$, on which the classical string motion becomes chaotic.

Learning the black hole metric from holographic conductivity
Kai Li,Yi Ling,Peng Liu,Meng-He Wu
We construct a neural network to learn the RN-AdS black hole metric based on the data of optical conductivity by holography. The linear perturbative equation for the Maxwell field is rewritten in terms of the optical conductivity such that the neural network is constructed based on the discretization of this differential equation. In contrast to all previous models in AdS/DL (deep learning) duality, the derivative of the metric function appears in the equation of motion and we propose distinct finite difference methods to discretize this function. The notion of the reduced conductivity is also proposed to avoid the divergence of the optical conductivity near the horizon.The dependence of the training outcomes on the location of the cutoff, the temperature as well as the frequency range is investigated in detail. This work provides a concrete example for the reconstruction of the bulk geometry with the given data on the boundary by deep learning.

More on entanglement properties of $Lif_4^{(2)}\times {S}^1\times S^5$ spacetime with string excitations
Sabyasachi Maulik
The $Lif_{4}^{(2)} \times S^1 \times S^5$ spacetime is an exact solution of $F1-D2-D8$ configuration in type IIA supergravity and can accommodate charged excitations of the fundamental string. By gauge/gravity duality, it is related to an excited state of a non-relativistic QFT with anisotropic Lifshitz scaling symmetry. We study mutual and tripartite information and entanglement wedge cross-section in bulk gravity for boundary subsystems that are disjoint strips of very narrow width. Our work helps understand the nature of entanglement in the QFT excited state, which is in general a mixed one.

Electrically charged multi-field configurations
D. Bazeia,M.A. Marques,M. Paganelly
In this work we investigate the presence of electrically charged structures that are localized in two and three spatial dimensions. We use the Maxwell-scalar Lagrangian to describe several systems with distinct interactions for the scalar fields. The procedure relies on finding first order differential equations that solve the equations of motion and ensure stability of the corresponding minimum energy solutions. We illustrate the many possibilities in two and in three spatial dimensions, examining different examples of electrically charged solutions that engender internal structure

AdS5 vacua and holographic RG flows from 5D N=4 gauged supergravity
Parinya Karndumri
We study five-dimensional $N=4$ gauged supergravity coupled to five vector multiplets with $SO(2)_D\times SO(3)\times SO(3)$ gauge group. There are four supersymmetric $AdS_5$ vacua in the truncation to $SO(2)_{\textrm{diag}}$ invariant scalars. Two of these vacua preserve the full $N=4$ supersymmetry with $SO(2)_D\times SO(3)\times SO(3)$ and $SO(2)_D\times SO(3)_{\textrm{diag}}$ symmetries. These have an analogue in $N=4$ gauged supergravity with $SO(2)\times SO(3)\times SO(3)$ gauge group. The other two $AdS_5$ vacua preserve only $N=2$ supersymmetry with $SO(2)_{\textrm{diag}}\times SO(3)$ and $SO(2)_{\textrm{diag}}$ symmetry. The former has an analogue in the previous study of $SO(2)_D\times SO(3)$ gauge group while the latter is a genuinely new $N=2$ $AdS_5$ vacuum. These vacua are dual to $N=2$ and $N=1$ superconformal field theories (SCFTs) in four dimensions with different flavour symmetries. We give the full scalar mass spectra at all of the $AdS_5$ critical points which provide information on conformal dimensions of the dual operators. Finally, we study holographic RG flows interpolating between these $AdS_5$ vacua and find a new class of solutions. In addition to the RG flows from the trivial $SO(2)_D\times SO(3)\times SO(3)$ $N=4$ critical point, at the origin of the scalar manifold, to all the other critical points, there is a family of RG flows from the trivial $N=4$ critical point to the new $SO(2)_{\textrm{diag}}$ $N=2$ critical point that pass arbitrarily close to the $SO(2)_D\times SO(3)_{\textrm{diag}}$ $N=4$ critical point.

Yangian-invariant fishnet integrals in 2 dimensions as volumes of Calabi-Yau varieties
Claude Duhr,Albrecht Klemm,Florian Loebbert,Christoph Nega,Franziska Porkert
We argue that $\ell$-loop Yangian-invariant fishnet integrals in 2 dimensions are connected to a family of Calabi-Yau $\ell$-folds. The value of the integral can be computed from the periods of the Calabi-Yau, while the Yangian generators provide its Picard-Fuchs differential ideal. Using mirror symmetry, we can identify the value of the integral as the quantum volume of the mirror Calabi-Yau. We find that, similar to what happens in string theory, for $\ell=1$ and 2 the value of the integral agrees with the classical volume of the mirror, but starting from $\ell=3$, the classical volume gets corrected by instanton contributions. We illustrate these claims on several examples, and we use them to provide for the first time results for 2- and 3-loop Yangian-invariant traintrack integrals in 2 dimensions for arbitrary external kinematics.

Revising the universality class of the four-dimensional Ising model - (cross-listed cond-mat.stat-mech)
P. H. Lundow,K. Markström
The aim of this paper is to determine the behavior of the specific heat of the 4-dimensional Ising model at the critical temperature, and via that determine if the Ising model and the $\phi^4$-model belong to the same universality class in dimension 4. In order to do this we have carried out what is currently the largest scale simulations of the 4-dimensional Ising model, extending the lattices size up to $L=256$ and the number of samples per size by several orders of magnitude compared to earlier works, keeping track of data for both the canonical and microcanonical ensembles. Our conclusion is that the Ising model has a bounded specific heat, while the $\phi^4$-model is known to have a logarithmic divergence at the critical point. Hence the two models belong to distinct universality classes in dimension 4.

Computer algebra calculations in supersymmetric electrodynamics
Ilya Shirokov
We propose a new symbolic algorithm and a C++ program for generating and calculating supersymmetric Feynman diagrams for ${\cal N}=1$ supersymmetric electrodynamics regularized by higher derivatives in four dimensions. According to standard rules, the program generates all diagrams that are necessary to calculate a specific contribution to the two-point Green function of matter superfields in the needed order, and then reduces the answer to the sum of Euclidean momentum integrals. At the moment, the program was used to calculate the anomalous dimension in ${\cal N}=1$ supersymmetric quantum electrodynamics, regularized by higher derivatives, in the three-loop approximation.

A study of the quantum Sinh-Gordon model with relativistic continuous matrix product states
Antoine Tilloy
I study the Sine-Gordon (SG) and Sinh-Gordon (ShG) quantum field theories with a recently introduced variational method, the relativistic continuous matrix product states (RCMPS). The main advantage is to work directly in the thermodynamic limit, and without any UV regulator. The SG model is well understood and integrable, which provides a convenient benchmark for the variational method and serves as a warm-up. RCMPS approximate the ground state of the SG model arbitrary well up to the free Fermion point [coupling $\beta=\sqrt{4\pi}$ in equal-time quantization convention, or $b=1/\sqrt{2}$ in CFT convention], where the ground energy collapses to $-\infty$, and some renormalized ansatz would be needed. The ShG model, while integrable, is less understood and its strong coupling regime $\beta \approx 1$ is subject to some controversy. RCMPS also fit the ground state of the ShG model up to approximately $b=1/\sqrt{2}$, after which their predictions start to deviate substantially from the "exact" results. This is more puzzling as nothing is expected to happen physically for the ShG model at that point (eg, the ground energy density does not diverge). Either the "exact" ShG results are not exact (the analytic continuation of the SG Bethe Ansatz solution is unwarranted), or, more likely, the physical structure of the ShG ground state changes in such a way that it becomes out of reach of the RCMPS manifold for reasonable bond dimensions.

Self-force regularization of a point particle for generic orbits in Kerr spacetime: electromagnetic and gravitational cases - (cross-listed gr-qc)
Anna Heffernan
The self-force is the leading method in modelling waveforms for extreme mass ratio inspirals, a key target of ESA's future space-based gravitational wave detector LISA. In modelling these systems, one approximates the smaller body as a point particle leading to problematic singularities that need to be removed. Modelling of this singular structure has settled on the Detweiler-Whiting singular field as the gold standard. As a solution to the governing wave equation itself, on removal, it leaves a smooth regular field that is a solution to the homogeneous wave equation, much like its well established flat spacetime counterpart. The mode-sum method enables subtraction of this singularity mode by mode via a spherical harmonic decomposition. The more modes one has, the faster the convergence in the $\ell$-sum, making these expressions highly beneficial, especially considering the heavy computational burden of waveform production. Until recently, only the two leading orders were known for generic orbits in Kerr spacetime. In a previous paper, we produced the next non-zero parameter for a scalar charged particle in curved spacetime, laying the groundwork for the electromagnetic and gravitational case which we present here.
