<h3>Universal horizons and black hole spectroscopy in gravitational theories with broken Lorentz symmetry - (cross-listed gr-qc)</h3>
<h4>Chao Zhang, Anzhong Wang, Tao Zhu</h4>
<p>The violation of Lorentz invariance (LI) in gravitational theories, which allows superluminal propagations, dramatically alters the causal structure of the spacetime and modifies the notion of black holes. In particular, instead of metric horizons, now {\it universal horizons} define the boundaries of black holes, within which a particle cannot escape to spatial infinities even with an infinitely large speed. Then, a natural question is how the quasi-normal modes (QNMs) of a black hole are modified, if one considers the universal horizon as its causal boundary. In this paper, we study in detail this problem in Einstein-aether theory, a vector-tensor theory that violates LI but yet is self-consistent and satisfies all observations carried out so far. Technically, this poses several challenges, including singularities of the perturbation equations across metric horizons and proper identifications of ingoing modes at universal horizons. After overcoming these difficulties, we show that the QNMs of the Schwarzschild black hole, also a solution of Einstein-aether theory, consist of two parts, the metric and aether parts. The QNMs of the metric perturbations are quite similar to those obtained in general relativity and are consistent with current observations of gravitational waves. But the ones from aether perturbations are different, and our numerical studies indicate that they are even not stable. The latter is consistent with our previous studies, which showed that the stealth Schwarzschild black hole suffers a Laplacian instability along the angular direction. The method and techniques developed in this paper can be applied to the studies of QNMs in other theories of gravity with broken LI.</p>

<h3>The effective potential of the Polyakov loop in the Hamiltonian approach to QCD - (cross-listed hep-ph)</h3>
<h4>Markus Quandt, Hugo Reinhardt</h4>
<p>We investigate the effective potential of the Polyakov loop, which is the order parameter for the deconfinement phase transition in finite temperature QCD. Our work is based on the Hamiltonian approach in Coulomb gauge where finite temperature $T$ is introduced by compactifying one space direction. We briefly review this approach and extend earlier work in the Yang-Mills sector by including dynamical quarks. In a first approximation, we follow the usual functional approach and include only one-loop contributions to the energy, with the finite temperature propagators replaced by their $T=0$ counter parts. It is found that this gives a poor description of the phase transition, in particular for the case of full QCD with $N_f = 3$ light flavours. The physical reasons for this unexpected result are discussed, and pinned down to a relative weakness of gluon confinement compared to the deconfining tendency of the quarks. We attempt to overcome this issue by including the relevant gluon contributions from the two-loop terms to the energy. We find that the two-loop corrections have indeed a tendency to strengthen the gluon confinement and weaken the unphysical effects in the confining phase, while slightly increasing the (pseudo-)critical temperature $T^\ast$ at the same time. To fully suppress artifacts in the confining phase, we must tune the parameters to rather large values, increasing the critical temperature to $T^\ast \approx 340\,\mathrm{MeV}$ for $G=SU(2)$.</p>

<h3>Unitarity and Dilaton effective theory - (cross-listed hep-ph)</h3>
<h4>Deog Ki Hong, Gyurin Kim, Jun Beom Park</h4>
<p>From the low-energy effective theory of dilatons, consistent with the scale anomaly, we calculate the $2\to2$ scattering amplitudes of dilatons. We find that the one-loop amplitude violates the unitarity bound as the scattering energy approaches the cutoff of the effective theory, $\sqrt{s}=\sqrt{4\pi} f_D$. We then show that the inclusion of the next-to-lightest state, namely the spin-2 state, of mass around the cutoff improves the unitarity. The unitarity argument suggests that the mass ratio of the dilaton and the spin-2 state is proportional to the square of the Miransky-BKT scaling of the near conformal dynamics.</p>

<h3>Geometry of Spin(10) Symmetry Breaking</h3>
<h4>Kirill Krasnov</h4>
<p>We provide a new characterisation of the Standard Model gauge group GSM as a subgroup of Spin(10). The new description of GSM relies on the geometry of pure spinors. We show that GSM inside Spin(10) is the group that stabilises a pure spinor psi_1 and projectively stabilises another pure spinor psi_2, with psi_{1,2} such that psi_2 is distinct from psi_1 and their arbitrary linear combination is still a pure spinor. Our characterisation of GSM relies on the facts that projective pure spinors describe complex structures on R^{10}, and the product of two commuting complex structures is a what is known as a product structure. For the pure spinors psi_{1,2} satisfying the stated conditions the arising product structure is R^{10}=R^6+R^4, giving rise to a copy of Pati-Salam gauge group inside Spin(10). Our main statement then follows from the fact that GSM is the intersection of the Georgi-Glashow SU(5) that stabilises psi_1, and the Pati-Salam Spin(6)x Spin(4) arising from the product structure determined by psi_{1,2}. We have tried to make the paper self-contained and provided a detailed description of the creation/annihilation operator construction of the Clifford algebras Cl(2n) and the geometry of pure spinors in dimensions up to and including ten.</p>

<h3>Chaotic string motion in a near pp-wave limit</h3>
<h4>Shodai Kushiro, Kentaroh Yoshida</h4>
<p>We revisit classical string motion in a near pp-wave limit of AdS$_5\times$S$^5$. It is known that the Toda lattice models are integrable. But if the exponential potential is truncated at finite order, then the system may become non-integrable. In particular, when the exponential potential in a three-particle periodic Toda chain is truncated at the third order of the dynamical variables, the resulting system becomes a well-known non-integrable system, Henon-Heiles model. The same thing may happen in a near pp-wave limit of AdS$_5\times$S$^5$, on which the classical string motion becomes chaotic.</p>

<h3>Yangian-invariant fishnet integrals in 2 dimensions as volumes of Calabi-Yau varieties</h3>
<h4>Claude Duhr, Albrecht Klemm, Florian Loebbert, Christoph Nega, Franziska Porkert</h4>
<p>We argue that $\ell$-loop Yangian-invariant fishnet integrals in 2 dimensions are connected to a family of Calabi-Yau $\ell$-folds. The value of the integral can be computed from the periods of the Calabi-Yau, while the Yangian generators provide its Picard-Fuchs differential ideal. Using mirror symmetry, we can identify the value of the integral as the quantum volume of the mirror Calabi-Yau. We find that, similar to what happens in string theory, for $\ell=1$ and 2 the value of the integral agrees with the classical volume of the mirror, but starting from $\ell=3$, the classical volume gets corrected by instanton contributions. We illustrate these claims on several examples, and we use them to provide for the first time results for 2- and 3-loop Yangian-invariant traintrack integrals in 2 dimensions for arbitrary external kinematics.</p>

<h3>Scattering wave functions for Aharonov-Bohm-Coulomb field: Path integral treatment</h3>
<h4>Nadira Boudiaf, Abdeldjalil Merdaci, Lyazid Chetouani</h4>
<p>Exact Green's functions related to Dirac particle submitted to the combination of Aharonov-Bohm and Coulomb fields in (2+1) coordinate space are analytically calculated via path integral formalism in both global and local representations. The scattering normalized wavefunctions as well as the corresponding continuous energy eigenvalues are extracted following this approach. The interesting properties of the spinors are thus deduced after symmetrization. According to the symmetric form for the Green's function, it is shown that the equivalence with Dirac equation is undertaken with much ease. Some particular cases are also considered.</p>
