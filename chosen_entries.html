<h3>Dark Sector Physics at High-Intensity Experiments - (cross-listed hep-ph)</h3>
<h4>Stefania Gori, Mike Williams, Phil Ilten, Nhan Tran, Gordan Krnjaic, Natalia Toro, Brian Batell, Nikita Blinov, Christopher Hearty, Robert McGehee, Philip Harris, Philip Schuster, Jure Zupan</h4>
<p>Is Dark Matter part of a Dark Sector? The possibility of a dark sector neutral under Standard Model (SM) forces furnishes an attractive explanation for the existence of Dark Matter (DM), and is a compelling new-physics direction to explore in its own right, with potential relevance to fundamental questions as varied as neutrino masses, the hierarchy problem, and the Universe's matter-antimatter asymmetry. Because dark sectors are generically weakly coupled to ordinary matter, and because they can naturally have MeV-to-GeV masses and respect the symmetries of the SM, they are only mildly constrained by high-energy collider data and precision atomic measurements. Yet upcoming and proposed intensity-frontier experiments will offer an unprecedented window into the physics of dark sectors, highlighted as a Priority Research Direction in the 2018 Dark Matter New Initiatives (DMNI) BRN report. Support for this program -- in the form of dark-sector analyses at multi-purpose experiments, realization of the intensity-frontier experiments receiving DMNI funds, an expansion of DMNI support to explore the full breadth of DM and visible final-state signatures (especially long-lived particles) called for in the BRN report, and support for a robust dark-sector theory effort -- will enable comprehensive exploration of low-mass thermal DM milestones, and greatly enhance the potential of intensity-frontier experiments to discover dark-sector particles decaying back to SM particles.</p>

<h3>Universal horizons and black hole spectroscopy in gravitational theories with broken Lorentz symmetry - (cross-listed gr-qc)</h3>
<h4>Chao Zhang, Anzhong Wang, Tao Zhu</h4>
<p>The violation of Lorentz invariance (LI) in gravitational theories, which allows superluminal propagations, dramatically alters the causal structure of the spacetime and modifies the notion of black holes. In particular, instead of metric horizons, now {\it universal horizons} define the boundaries of black holes, within which a particle cannot escape to spatial infinities even with an infinitely large speed. Then, a natural question is how the quasi-normal modes (QNMs) of a black hole are modified, if one considers the universal horizon as its causal boundary. In this paper, we study in detail this problem in Einstein-aether theory, a vector-tensor theory that violates LI but yet is self-consistent and satisfies all observations carried out so far. Technically, this poses several challenges, including singularities of the perturbation equations across metric horizons and proper identifications of ingoing modes at universal horizons. After overcoming these difficulties, we show that the QNMs of the Schwarzschild black hole, also a solution of Einstein-aether theory, consist of two parts, the metric and aether parts. The QNMs of the metric perturbations are quite similar to those obtained in general relativity and are consistent with current observations of gravitational waves. But the ones from aether perturbations are different, and our numerical studies indicate that they are even not stable. The latter is consistent with our previous studies, which showed that the stealth Schwarzschild black hole suffers a Laplacian instability along the angular direction. The method and techniques developed in this paper can be applied to the studies of QNMs in other theories of gravity with broken LI.</p>
